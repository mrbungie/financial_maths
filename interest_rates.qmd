# Interest & Discount Rates

## Introduction

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Building on the Value Function

In the previous chapter on [Value Function](value_function.qmd), we learned how $V(t)$ describes the financial position of a cashflow stream at any time $t$. Now, we'll see how interest rates, discount rates, and accumulation factors are all **manifestations** of this value function—different ways of reading the same underlying information.

Interest rates represent the **risk-free price of time** in an ideal financial world. They answer the fundamental question: *"What is the pure cost of waiting for money?"* 

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Ideal World Assumption

For now, we focus on the **risk-free interest rate** in a frictionless market:

- No default risk
- No inflation
- Perfect liquidity
- No transaction costs

This represents the **pure time preference**: how much more valuable money is today compared to tomorrow, stripped of all real-world complications.

**Reality check**: Real-world interest rates include additional components (inflation premium, default risk, liquidity premium). We'll address these complexities later.

## Interest and Discount: Manifestations of the Value Function

Rather than treating interest rates as standalone concepts, we express them as **direct consequences** of the value function $V(t)$. Every interest-related quantity is simply a different way of comparing values at two time points.

### Conceptual Overview: Six Ways to Measure Time Value

Before diving into formulas, let's understand what each quantity represents in plain language:

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## The Six Manifestations in Everyday Language

Imagine you invest money at time $t$ and check the result at time $t+\tau$. You can describe this transaction in six different ways:

**Absolute Measures (in currency):**

1. **Interest** ($I$): "How much money did I gain?"
   - *Example*: "I earned €21 in profit"
   - Measures the raw dollar/euro gain

2. **Discount** ($D$): "How much extra money will I receive in the future?"
   - *Example*: "The future payment includes €21 of growth"
   - Same as interest, but viewed from the future looking back

**Relative Measures (as percentages):**

3. **Interest rate** ($i$): "What percentage return did I earn?"
   - *Example*: "I earned a 21% return on my investment"
   - Measures return per euro invested

4. **Discount rate** ($d$): "What fraction of the future value is interest?"
   - *Example*: "The interest represents 17.4% of the final amount"
   - Measures interest as a fraction of the ending value

**Multiplicative Factors (as multipliers):**

5. **Accumulation factor** ($m$): "What multiplier transforms present to future value?"
   - *Example*: "Each euro becomes 1.21 euros"
   - How much does €1 grow to?

6. **Discount factor** ($v$): "What multiplier transforms future to present value?"
   - *Example*: "Each future euro is worth 0.826 euros today"
   - How much is a future €1 worth now?

**The key insight**: All six are just different ways of reading the same information from the value function $V(t)$.
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: The Value Function Lens

Think of $V(t)$ as the **master function** that describes how money grows over time. All other quantities are just different **perspectives** on this single underlying reality:

- **Value function** $V(t)$: "What is the monetary value of the entire investment at time $t$?"
- **Interest** $I(t,t+\tau)$: "How many *dollars/euros* do I gain?" (absolute)
- **Interest rate** $i(t,t+\tau)$: "By what *percentage* does value grow?" (relative)
- **Accumulation factor** $m(t,t+\tau)$: "What's the *multiplicative factor* for growth?" (also: "How much is $1 at time $t$ worth at time $t+\tau$?")
- **Discount** $D(t,t+\tau)$: "How many *dollars/euros* represent the gain?" (absolute, from future perspective)
- **Discount rate** $d(t,t+\tau)$: "By what *percentage* must I shrink future value to get present value?" (relative)
- **Discount factor** $v(t,t+\tau)$: "What's the *multiplicative factor* for shrinking?" (also: "How much is $1 at time $t+\tau$ worth at time $t$?")

All are **manifestations** of the same phenomenon: the time value of money encoded in $V(t)$.
:::

### Interest vs. Interest Rate: Absolute vs. Relative

::: {.callout-important icon=true}
## Two Different Manifestations: Absolute and Relative

From the value function, we can extract **two fundamentally different types** of measures:

**1. Interest (Absolute Amount)**:
$$
I(t, t+\tau) = V(t+\tau) - V(t)
$$

- **Units**: Currency (€, $, etc.)
- **Meaning**: "How many dollars/euros do I gain?"
- **Example**: "I earned €21"

**2. Interest Rate (Relative Percentage)**:
$$
i(t, t+\tau) = \frac{V(t+\tau) - V(t)}{V(t)} = \frac{I(t, t+\tau)}{V(t)}
$$

- **Units**: Dimensionless (percentage)
- **Meaning**: "What fraction of my initial investment do I gain?"
- **Example**: "I earned 21% return"

**The key difference**: Interest tells you the **dollar gain**, interest rate tells you the **return per dollar invested**.
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: Why Both Matter

**Interest (absolute)** = "How much richer am I?"
- If $V(0) = 100$ and $V(2) = 121$, then $I(0,2) = 121 - 100 = 21$ euros
- Direct measure of wealth increase

**Interest rate (relative)** = "How good was my investment?"
- $i(0,2) = \frac{21}{100} = 0.21 = 21\%$
- Allows comparison across different investment sizes

**Why we need both**:
- Earning €21 on €100 investment (21% return) is **excellent**
- Earning €21 on €10,000 investment (0.21% return) is **terrible**

The **same interest** (€21) has completely different meanings depending on the starting amount. That's why we need the **interest rate** to normalize by the initial value.

**Relationship**: $i(t, t+\tau) = \frac{I(t, t+\tau)}{V(t)}$ → Interest rate is interest per unit of initial value.
:::

### Interest Rate: Growth Perspective

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Interest Rate from Value Function

The **interest rate** measures the fractional increase in value:

$$
i(t, t+\tau) = \frac{V(t+\tau) - V(t)}{V(t)}
$$

**Interpretation**: "What percentage return do I earn from time $t$ to time $t+\tau$?"
:::

### Accumulation Factor: Growth Multiplier

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Accumulation Factor from Value Function

The **accumulation factor** measures how much $1 at time $t$ grows to at time $t+\tau$:

$$
m(t, t+\tau) = \frac{V(t+\tau)}{V(t)}
$$

**Relationship to interest rate**:
$$
m(t, t+\tau) = 1 + i(t, t+\tau)
$$
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: Interest Rate vs. Accumulation Factor

- **Interest rate** $i$: Answers "How much *extra* do I get?" (the *gain*)
- **Accumulation factor** $m$: Answers "What *total multiple* do I get?" (the *multiplier*)

**Example**: If $i = 0.21$, you earn 21% extra → $m = 1.21$, your money multiplies by 1.21.

They're two sides of the same coin:
- $i$ focuses on the *change* (gain/loss)
- $m$ focuses on the *ratio* (before/after)

### Discount Rate: Shrinking Perspective

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Discount Rate from Value Function

The **discount rate** measures the fractional decrease when moving backward in time:

$$
d(t, t+\tau) = \frac{V(t+\tau) - V(t)}{V(t+\tau)}
$$

**Interpretation**: "What percentage of future value represents the interest component?"
:::

### Discount Factor: Shrinking Multiplier

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Discount Factor from Value Function

The **discount factor** measures how much $1 at time $t+\tau$ is worth at time $t$:

$$
v(t, t+\tau) = \frac{V(t)}{V(t+\tau)} = \frac{1}{m(t,t+\tau)}
$$

**Relationship to discount rate**:
$$
v(t, t+\tau) = 1 - d(t, t+\tau)
$$
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: Discount = Accumulation in Reverse

Discounting is just **accumulation running backward**:

- **Forward (Accumulation)**: "Grow $1 from today to future" → multiply by $m = V(t+\tau)/V(t)$
- **Backward (Discount)**: "Shrink $1 from future to today" → multiply by $v = V(t)/V(t+\tau) = 1/m$

They're **inverses**: $m \times v = 1$

**Visual analogy**: 
- Accumulation = telescope 🔭 (magnify the future)
- Discount = time machine ⏪ (bring the future to present, making it smaller)
:::

### The Six Manifestations: Summary

::: {.callout-important icon=true}
## All Six Quantities from One Function

Given the value function $V(t)$, we can extract **six related quantities** for any time interval $[t, t+\tau]$:

| Quantity | Formula | Measures | Type | Units |
|----------|---------|----------|------|-------|
| **Interest** | $I = V(t+\tau)-V(t)$ | Absolute gain | Amount | Currency (€, $) |
| **Interest rate** | $i = \frac{V(t+\tau)-V(t)}{V(t)}$ | Fractional growth | Rate | Dimensionless (%) |
| **Accumulation factor** | $m = \frac{V(t+\tau)}{V(t)}$ | Growth multiplier | Factor | Dimensionless |
| **Discount** | $D = V(t+\tau)-V(t)$ | Absolute gain | Amount | Currency (€, $) |
| **Discount rate** | $d = \frac{V(t+\tau)-V(t)}{V(t+\tau)}$ | Fractional shrinkage | Rate | Dimensionless (%) |
| **Discount factor** | $v = \frac{V(t)}{V(t+\tau)}$ | Shrinkage multiplier | Factor | Dimensionless |

**Note**: $I = D$ (both measure the same absolute difference), but they're used in different contexts (forward vs. backward perspective).

**Key relationships**:

*Absolute to Relative (normalization):*

- $i = \frac{I}{V(t)}$ (interest rate = interest per unit of initial value)
- $d = \frac{D}{V(t+\tau)}$ (discount rate = discount per unit of future value)

*Between factors and rates:*

- $m = 1 + i$ (accumulation factor = 1 plus interest rate)
- $v = 1 - d$ (discount factor = 1 minus discount rate)

*Between accumulation and discount:*

- $v = 1/(1+i) = 1/m$ (discount factor = reciprocal of accumulation)
- $d = i/(1+i)$ (discount rate from interest rate)
- $i = d/(1-d)$ (interest rate from discount rate)

**The beauty**: Choose *any one* of these six, and you can derive the other five. They're different views of the same underlying reality encoded in $V(t)$.

### Summary Table: Complete Reference

::: {.callout-important icon=true}
## Six Manifestations of the Value Function

| Quantity | Symbol | Formula | Units | Question Answered | Type |
|----------|--------|---------|-------|-------------------|------|
| **Interest** | $I(t, t+\tau)$ | $V(t+\tau) - V(t)$ | Currency (€, $) | "How many dollars/euros do I gain?" | Absolute |
| **Interest rate** | $i(t, t+\tau)$ | $\frac{V(t+\tau) - V(t)}{V(t)}$ | Dimensionless (%) | "What percentage return do I earn?" | Relative |
| **Accumulation factor** | $m(t, t+\tau)$ | $\frac{V(t+\tau)}{V(t)}$ | Dimensionless | "What multiplier grows present to future?" | Factor |
| **Discount** | $D(t, t+\tau)$ | $V(t+\tau) - V(t)$ | Currency (€, $) | "How much extra is in the future value?" | Absolute |
| **Discount rate** | $d(t, t+\tau)$ | $\frac{V(t+\tau) - V(t)}{V(t+\tau)}$ | Dimensionless (%) | "What fraction of future value is interest?" | Relative |
| **Discount factor** | $v(t, t+\tau)$ | $\frac{V(t)}{V(t+\tau)}$ | Dimensionless | "What multiplier shrinks future to present?" | Factor |

**Conversion Formulas:**

| From | To | Formula |
|------|-----|---------|
| Interest $I$ | Interest rate $i$ | $i = \frac{I}{V(t)}$ |
| Interest rate $i$ | Accumulation factor $m$ | $m = 1 + i$ |
| Interest rate $i$ | Discount rate $d$ | $d = \frac{i}{1+i}$ |
| Interest rate $i$ | Discount factor $v$ | $v = \frac{1}{1+i}$ |
| Discount $D$ | Discount rate $d$ | $d = \frac{D}{V(t+\tau)}$ |
| Discount rate $d$ | Interest rate $i$ | $i = \frac{d}{1-d}$ |
| Discount rate $d$ | Discount factor $v$ | $v = 1 - d$ |
| Accumulation factor $m$ | Discount factor $v$ | $v = \frac{1}{m}$ |

**Quick Reference:**

- $I = D$ (numerically identical, different perspectives)
- $m \times v = 1$ (accumulation and discount factors are reciprocals)
- $i + d = i \times d$ (relationship: $d = \frac{i}{1+i}$ and $i = \frac{d}{1-d}$)
- All six can be derived from knowing just $V(t)$ and $V(t+\tau)$

**Given**: A transaction summarized by this value function:

| $t$ | $V(t)$ |
|-----|--------|
| 0   | 100    |
| 1   | 101    |
| 1.5 | 105    |
| 2   | 110    |
| 4   | 111    |

**Calculate all six quantities for the interval $[0, 1]$**:

**1. Interest** (absolute gain in currency):
$$
I(0,1) = V(1) - V(0) = 101 - 100 = 1 \text{ euro}
$$
*"I gained 1 euro in absolute terms."*

**2. Interest rate** (fractional gain as percentage):
$$
i(0,1) = \frac{V(1) - V(0)}{V(0)} = \frac{101 - 100}{100} = \frac{1}{100} = 1\% = 0.01
$$
*"I earned a 1% return on my initial investment."*

**Notice**: $i(0,1) = \frac{I(0,1)}{V(0)} = \frac{1}{100}$ → Interest rate normalizes interest by initial value!

**3. Accumulation factor** (growth multiplier):
$$
m(0,1) = \frac{V(1)}{V(0)} = \frac{101}{100} = 1.01
$$
*"Each euro at time 0 becomes 1.01 euros at time 1."*

**4. Discount** (absolute gain, same as Interest):
$$
D(0,1) = V(1) - V(0) = 101 - 100 = 1 \text{ euro}
$$
*Note: $D = I$ numerically, but used when discounting from future to present.*

**5. Discount rate** (fractional shrinkage):
$$
d(0,1) = \frac{V(1) - V(0)}{V(1)} = \frac{1}{101} \approx 0.0099 = 0.99\%
$$
*"The interest represents 0.99% of the future value."*

**6. Discount factor** (shrinkage multiplier):
$$
v(0,1) = \frac{V(0)}{V(1)} = \frac{100}{101} \approx 0.9901
$$
*"Each euro at time 1 is worth 0.9901 euros at time 0."*

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Notice the Pattern

**Absolute vs. Relative**:
- $i = I/V(0) = 1/100 = 0.01$ (interest rate = interest per unit initial value) ✓
- $d = D/V(1) = 1/101 \approx 0.0099$ (discount rate = discount per unit future value) ✓

**Factor relationships**:
- $m = 1.01 = 1 + i$ (accumulation factor = 1 plus interest rate) ✓
- $v = 1/1.01 \approx 0.9901 = 1/m$ (discount factor = reciprocal of accumulation) ✓  
- $d \approx 0.0099 = i/(1+i) = 0.01/1.01$ (discount rate from interest rate) ✓

All relationships check out! From the value function alone, we extracted **six consistent quantities**.
:::

**Now for interval $[2, 4]$**:

$$
i(2,4) = \frac{V(4) - V(2)}{V(2)} = \frac{111-110}{110} = \frac{1}{110} \approx 0.909\%
$$

$$
m(2,4) = \frac{111}{110} \approx 1.00909
$$

**Observation**: Interest rate varies across time intervals! Between years 0-1, the rate is 1%. Between years 2-4, it's only 0.909%. This is why we write $i(t, t+\tau)$ with explicit time dependence.

## Why This Approach Matters

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Power of the Value Function Framework

**Traditional approach**: Learn interest rates, discount rates, accumulation factors as separate formulas. Memorize relationships.

**Value function approach**: 
1. Understand $V(t)$ = the master function describing financial growth
2. Every other quantity is just a **ratio or difference** of $V$ at two time points
3. All relationships follow automatically from this definition

**Benefits**:

1. **Unified understanding**: One concept ($V(t)$) generates everything else
2. **Handles complexity naturally**: Variable rates, multiple periods, different structures all fit seamlessly
3. **Exam superpower**: Forget a formula? Derive it from $V(t)$ on the spot
4. **Deeper insight**: See *why* formulas work, not just *that* they work

**Bottom line**: Master $V(t)$, and interest rates become different ways of reading the same story.
