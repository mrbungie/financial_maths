# Interest & Discount Rates

## Introduction

Interest rates are the **engine** of financial mathematics. They answer the fundamental question: *"What is the price of time?"* In this chapter, we'll explore how interest rates work, how they relate to discount factors, and how they transform money across time.

## The Time Value of Money

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Core Principle: Time Value of Money
**A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow.**

Why? Three main reasons:

1. **Opportunity cost**: Today's dollar can be invested to earn returns
2. **Inflation**: Future dollars have less purchasing power
3. **Risk**: Future payments are uncertain
:::

Interest rates **quantify** this time value: they tell us precisely *how much more* a dollar today is worth compared to a dollar later.

## Two Directions: Accumulation vs. Discount

Think of interest rates as a **bidirectional lens** for viewing money across time:

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## The "Money Lens" Analogy

**ðŸ”­ Accumulation = Telescope (Forward View)**  
Looking into the future: *"If I invest $100 today, how much will I have later?"*  
Answer: **More** (money grows)

**ðŸ”¬ Discount = Microscope (Backward View)**  
Looking back to present: *"If I need $100 in the future, how much should I set aside today?"*  
Answer: **Less** (future dollars are worth less today)

## Accumulation: Growing Money Forward

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Accumulation Factor
The **accumulation factor** $a(t)$ tells you how much $1$ today grows to at time $t$:

$$
a(t) = (1 + i)^t
$$

Where $i$ is the interest rate per period.
:::

### Example: Accumulation

**Question**: You invest $1,000$ today at 6\% annual interest. How much will you have in 5 years?

**Solution**:
$$
FV = 1000 \times (1.06)^5 = 1000 \times 1.3382 = \$1,338.20
$$

**Timeline View**:

| Time (years) | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|--------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Amount | $1,000.00 | $1,060.00 | $1,123.60 | $1,191.02 | $1,262.48 | $1,338.23 |
| Growth | â€” | +$60 | +$63.60 | +$67.42 | +$71.46 | +$75.75 |

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Notice
Each year's growth is **larger** than the previous yearâ€”that's **compound interest** at work! You earn interest not just on your original $1,000, but also on previously earned interest.
:::

## Discount: Shrinking Money Backward

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Discount Factor
The **discount factor** $v^t$ tells you how much $1$ at time $t$ is worth today:

$$
v^t = \frac{1}{(1+i)^t}
$$

Alternatively, we can define $v = \frac{1}{1+i}$ (the one-period discount factor), so:

$$
v^t = \left(\frac{1}{1+i}\right)^t
$$
:::

### Example: Discounting

**Question**: You need $1,000$ in 5 years. If the interest rate is 6\%, how much should you set aside today?

**Solution**:
$$
PV = \frac{1000}{(1.06)^5} = \frac{1000}{1.3382} = \$747.26
$$

**Interpretation**: If you invest $747.26$ today at 6\%, it will grow to exactly $1,000$ in 5 years.

### Discount Rate vs. Interest Rate

::: {.callout-important icon=true}
## Key Relationship
For the **same** time value of money:

- **Interest rate** $i$: Used for accumulation (moving forward)
- **Discount rate** $i$: Same rate, used for discounting (moving backward)
- **Discount factor** $v = \frac{1}{1+i}$

They're two sides of the same coin:

$$
(1+i) \times v = (1+i) \times \frac{1}{1+i} = 1
$$
:::

## Effective vs. Nominal Rates

Real-world interest rates come in different flavors depending on **compounding frequency**.

### Effective Annual Rate (EAR)

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Effective Annual Rate
The **effective annual rate** is the actual annual return, accounting for compounding within the year.

If interest is compounded $m$ times per year at rate $i_m$ per period:

$$
\text{EAR} = \left(1 + \frac{i_m}{m}\right)^m - 1
$$
:::

### Example: Quarterly Compounding

**Given**: Bank offers 8\% annual rate, compounded quarterly (4 times/year).

**What's the effective annual rate?**

- Quarterly rate: $i_4 = 8\% / 4 = 2\%$ per quarter
- Effective annual rate:

$$
\text{EAR} = (1.02)^4 - 1 = 1.0824 - 1 = 8.24\%
$$

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Interpretation
Due to compounding, you effectively earn **8.24\%** per year, not just 8\%. The more frequent the compounding, the higher the effective rate.
:::

### Compounding Frequency Comparison

For a **nominal rate of 12\%** per year:

| Compounding | Formula | Effective Rate |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Annual | $(1.12)^1 - 1$ | **12.00\%** |
| Semi-annual | $(1.06)^2 - 1$ | **12.36\%** |
| Quarterly | $(1.03)^4 - 1$ | **12.55\%** |
| Monthly | $(1.01)^{12} - 1$ | **12.68\%** |
| Daily | $(1 + 0.12/365)^{365} - 1$ | **12.75\%** |
| Continuous | $e^{0.12} - 1$ | **12.75\%** |

\end{figure}
```

## Continuous Compounding

As compounding becomes more frequent, the effective rate approaches a limit:

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Continuous Compounding
When interest compounds **continuously** (infinitely often), the accumulation formula becomes:

$$
FV = PV \times e^{rt}
$$

Where:
- $e \approx 2.71828$ (Euler's number)
- $r$ = continuously compounded rate
- $t$ = time
:::

### Example: Continuous vs. Annual

**Invest $1,000 at 10\% for 3 years:**

| Compounding | Formula | Future Value |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| Annual | $1000 \times (1.10)^3$ | **$1,331.00** |
| Continuous | $1000 \times e^{0.10 \times 3}$ | **$1,349.86** |

**Difference**: $1,349.86 âˆ’ $1,331.00 = **$18.86** extra from continuous compounding.

## Interest Rate Decomposition

Real-world interest rates have multiple components:

::: {.callout-important icon=true}
## Interest Rate Components

$$
i = r_f + \text{inflation} + \text{risk premium} + \text{liquidity premium}
$$

Where:
- **$r_f$**: Real risk-free rate (time preference)
- **Inflation**: Compensation for loss of purchasing power
- **Risk premium**: Compensation for default risk
- **Liquidity premium**: Compensation for illiquidity
:::

### Example: Corporate Bond Rate

A corporate bond might have:

- Risk-free rate: 2%
- Expected inflation: 3%
- Default risk premium: 2%
- Liquidity premium: 1%
- **Total rate**: 2% + 3% + 2% + 1% = **8%**

## Present Value of Annuities

A common cashflow pattern is an **annuity**: equal payments at regular intervals.

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Annuity
An **annuity** is a series of equal payments $C$ made at regular intervals for $n$ periods.

**Present value of an annuity**:

$$
PV = C \times \frac{1 - v^n}{i} = C \times \frac{1 - (1+i)^{-n}}{i}
$$

This is often denoted as $PV = C \times a_{\overline{n}|i}$ where $a_{\overline{n}|i}$ is the annuity factor.
:::

### Example: Mortgage Payment

**You take a $200,000 mortgage at 5\% for 30 years. What's the monthly payment?**

Given:
- $PV = 200,000$
- $i = 5\% / 12 = 0.4167\%$ per month
- $n = 30 \times 12 = 360$ months

Rearranging: $C = PV \times \frac{i}{1 - (1+i)^{-n}}$

$$
C = 200,000 \times \frac{0.004167}{1 - (1.004167)^{-360}} = 200,000 \times 0.00537 = \$1,073.64
$$

**Your monthly payment**: **$1,073.64**

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
```

## Perpetuity: The Infinite Annuity

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Perpetuity
A **perpetuity** is an annuity that continues forever.

**Present value**:

$$
PV = \frac{C}{i}
$$

As $n \to \infty$, the annuity formula simplifies to this beautifully simple result.
:::

### Example: Preferred Stock

A preferred stock pays $5 per share annually forever. If the required return is 8\%, what's it worth?

$$
PV = \frac{5}{0.08} = \$62.50
$$

## Summary Table: Key Formulas

| Concept | Formula | Use |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Accumulation** | $FV = PV \times (1+i)^t$ | Growing money forward |
| **Discount** | $PV = FV \times (1+i)^{-t}$ | Bringing money to present |
| **Discount factor** | $v = \frac{1}{1+i}$ | One-period discounting |
| **Effective rate** | $(1 + i_m/m)^m - 1$ | Accounting for compounding |
| **Continuous** | $FV = PV \times e^{rt}$ | Continuous compounding |
| **Annuity PV** | $C \times \frac{1-v^n}{i}$ | Series of equal payments |
| **Perpetuity PV** | $\frac{C}{i}$ | Forever payments |

## Practical Insights

::: {.callout-important icon=true}
## Using the Right Rate

**Always match**:
- **Time period** of cashflows (monthly, annual, etc.)
- **Compounding frequency** of the rate
- **Risk level** (risk-free rate vs. risky rate)

Example: For monthly mortgage payments, use monthly interest rate, not annual.
:::

::: {.callout-warning icon=true}
## Common Mistakes

1. **Mixing rates**: Using annual rate for monthly cashflows
2. **Forgetting compounding**: Treating 6\% semi-annual as 6\% annual
3. **Wrong perspective**: Confusing investor vs. borrower viewpoint
4. **Sign errors**: Getting cashflow directions backward
:::

## Summary

âœ… **Interest rate** $i$ = price of time, quantifies time value of money  
âœ… **Accumulation** (forward) vs. **Discount** (backward) = two directions  
âœ… **Compound interest** = interest on interest (grows exponentially)  
âœ… **Effective rate** accounts for compounding frequency  
âœ… **Continuous compounding** = infinite frequency limit  
âœ… **Annuities** = equal periodic payments (closed-form PV formula)  
âœ… **Perpetuities** = infinite annuities ($PV = C/i$)
