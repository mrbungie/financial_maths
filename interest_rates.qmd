## 1. From Value Function to Rates

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Building on the Value Function

In the previous chapter on [Value Function](value_function.qmd), we learned how $V(t)$ describes the financial position of a cashflow stream at any time $t$. Now, we'll see how interest rates, discount rates, and accumulation factors are all **manifestations** of this value function—different ways of reading the same underlying information.
:::

**Foundation**: $V(t)$ = value of an investment at time $t$.

**All rates/factors** = different ways of comparing $V(t)$ with $V(t+\tau)$.

**Six manifestations**:

1. Absolute gain → *Interest, Discount*
2. Relative growth → *Interest rate, Discount rate*  
3. Multipliers → *Accumulation factor, Discount factor*

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Ideal World Assumption

For now, we focus on the **risk-free interest rate** in a frictionless market:

- No default risk
- No inflation
- Perfect liquidity
- No transaction costs

This represents the **pure time preference**: how much more valuable money is today compared to tomorrow, stripped of all real-world complications.

**Reality check**: Real-world interest rates include additional components (inflation premium, default risk, liquidity premium). We'll address these complexities later.

## 2. The Six Manifestations (Plain Language)

Imagine you invest money at time $t$ and check the result at time $t+\tau$. You can describe this transaction in six different ways:

| Type | Quantity | Symbol | Question Answered | Example |
|------|----------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| **Absolute** | Interest | $I$ | How much money did I gain? | €21 profit |
| | Discount | $D$ | How much extra is in the future value? | €21 of growth |
| **Relative** | Interest rate | $i$ | What % did I earn on today's money? | 21% return |
| | Discount rate | $d$ | What % of future value is interest? | 17.4% |
| **Multipliers** | Accumulation factor | $m$ | How many euros does €1 become? | €1 → €1.21 |
| | Discount factor | $v$ | How much is €1 future worth today? | €1 future → €0.826 today |

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Mnemonic: Three Perspectives on Growth

- **Interest/Discount**: raw € differences (absolute)
- **Rates**: % comparisons (relative)
- **Factors**: multipliers (scaling)

**The key insight**: All six are just different ways of reading the same information from the value function $V(t)$.
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: The Value Function Lens

Think of $V(t)$ as the **master function** that describes how money grows over time. All other quantities are just different **perspectives** on this single underlying reality:

- **Value function** $V(t)$: "What's the value at time $t$?"
- **Interest** $I(t,t+\tau)$: "How many euros do I gain?"
- **Interest rate** $i(t,t+\tau)$: "What percentage return do I get?"
- **Accumulation factor** $m(t,t+\tau)$: "How much does €1 become?"
- **Discount** $D(t,t+\tau)$: "How many euros represent the gain?" (same as interest)
- **Discount rate** $d(t,t+\tau)$: "What percentage of the future value is gain?"
- **Discount factor** $v(t,t+\tau)$: "How much is a future €1 worth today?"

All are **manifestations** of the same phenomenon: the time value of money encoded in $V(t)$.

## 3. Core Definitions

### Absolute (currency)

::: {.callout-important icon=true}
## Interest and Discount

**Interest** $I(t, t+\tau)$ = absolute gain in currency
$$
I(t, t+\tau) = V(t+\tau) - V(t)
$$

- **Units**: Currency (€, $, etc.)
- **Meaning**: "How many dollars/euros do I gain?"
- **Example**: "I earned €21"

**Discount** $D(t, t+\tau)$ = same absolute gain, viewed from future
$$
D(t, t+\tau) = V(t+\tau) - V(t)
$$

- **Units**: Currency (€, $, etc.)
- **Meaning**: "How much extra is in the future value?"
- **Example**: "The future payment includes €21 of growth"

**Note**: $I = D$ numerically (both measure the same absolute difference), but they're used in different contexts (forward vs. backward perspective).
:::

**Why we need rates too**:

Earning €21 on €100 investment (21% return) is **excellent**, but earning €21 on €10,000 investment (0.21% return) is **terrible**.

The **same interest** (€21) has completely different meanings depending on the starting amount. That's why we need the **interest rate** to normalize by the initial value.

### Relative (%)

::: {.callout-important icon=true}
## Interest Rate and Discount Rate

**Interest rate** $i(t, t+\tau)$ = fractional growth from present perspective
$$
i(t, t+\tau) = \frac{V(t+\tau) - V(t)}{V(t)} = \frac{I(t, t+\tau)}{V(t)}
$$

- **Units**: Dimensionless (percentage)
- **Meaning**: "What fraction of my initial investment do I gain?"
- **Example**: "I earned 21% return"

**Discount rate** $d(t, t+\tau)$ = fractional shrinkage from future perspective
$$
d(t, t+\tau) = \frac{V(t+\tau) - V(t)}{V(t+\tau)} = \frac{D(t, t+\tau)}{V(t+\tau)}
$$

- **Units**: Dimensionless (percentage)
- **Meaning**: "What percentage of future value represents the interest component?"
- **Example**: "The interest represents 17.4% of the final amount"

**The key difference**: Interest rate tells you the **return per dollar invested** (normalizes by present value), discount rate tells you **what fraction of future value is gain** (normalizes by future value).
:::

### Multipliers

::: {.callout-important icon=true}
## Accumulation Factor and Discount Factor

**Accumulation factor** $m(t, t+\tau)$ = how much €1 grows to
$$
m(t, t+\tau) = \frac{V(t+\tau)}{V(t)}
$$

- **Meaning**: "If I invest €1 today, how much do I have later?"
- **Example**: "€1 becomes €1.21"
- **Relationship to interest rate**: $m(t, t+\tau) = 1 + i(t, t+\tau)$

**Discount factor** $v(t, t+\tau)$ = what a future €1 is worth today
$$
v(t, t+\tau) = \frac{V(t)}{V(t+\tau)} = \frac{1}{m(t,t+\tau)}
$$

- **Meaning**: "If I get €1 in the future, what's it worth now?"
- **Example**: "A future €1 is worth €0.826 today"
- **Relationship to discount rate**: $v(t, t+\tau) = 1 - d(t, t+\tau)$
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: Rates vs. Factors

**Interest rate vs. Accumulation factor**:

- **Interest rate** $i$: Answers "How much *extra* do I get?" (the *gain*)
- **Accumulation factor** $m$: Answers "What does my €1 become?" (the *total*)

**Example**: If $i = 0.21$, you earn 21% extra → $m = 1.21$, so €1 becomes €1.21.

They're two sides of the same coin:

- $i$ focuses on the *change* (gain/loss)
- $m$ focuses on the *ratio* (before/after)

**Discount = Accumulation in Reverse**:

Discounting is just **accumulation running backward**:

- **Forward (Accumulation)**: "€1 today grows to what?" → $m = V(t+\tau)/V(t)$
- **Backward (Discount)**: "€1 in the future is worth what today?" → $v = V(t)/V(t+\tau) = 1/m$

They're **inverses**: $m \times v = 1$

**Visual analogy**:

- Accumulation = telescope 🔭 (magnify the future)
- Discount = time machine ⏪ (bring the future to present, making it smaller)

## 4. Relationships (Conversion Map)

Once you know **any one** of the six quantities, you can derive all the others. Here's your conversion toolkit:

::: {.callout-important icon=true}
## Conversion Formulas

| Start with… | Get… | Formula |
|------------|------|---------|
| Interest $I$ | Interest rate $i$ | $i = \dfrac{I}{V(t)}$ |
| Interest rate $i$ | Accumulation factor $m$ | $m = 1 + i$ |
| Interest rate $i$ | Discount rate $d$ | $d = \dfrac{i}{1+i}$ |
| Interest rate $i$ | Discount factor $v$ | $v = \dfrac{1}{1+i}$ |
| Discount $D$ | Discount rate $d$ | $d = \dfrac{D}{V(t+\tau)}$ |
| Discount rate $d$ | Interest rate $i$ | $i = \dfrac{d}{1-d}$ |
| Discount rate $d$ | Discount factor $v$ | $v = 1 - d$ |
| Accumulation factor $m$ | Discount factor $v$ | $v = \dfrac{1}{m}$ |

**Checkpoints** (to verify your calculations):

- $I = D$ (same number, different viewpoint)
- $m \cdot v = 1$ (accumulation and discount factors are reciprocals)
- $d = \dfrac{i}{1+i}$ (discount rate is "compressed" interest rate)
- $m = 1 + i$ and $v = 1 - d$ (factors are "shifted" rates)

**Given**: A transaction summarized by this value function:

| $t$ | $V(t)$ |
|-----|--------|
| 0   | 100    |
| 1   | 101    |
| 2   | 110    |
| 4   | 111    |

Let's calculate all six quantities for the interval $[0, 1]$ and then for $[2, 4]$.
:::

### Interval [0, 1]

**1. Interest** (absolute gain):
$$
I(0,1) = V(1) - V(0) = 101 - 100 = 1 \text{ euro}
$$
*"I gained €1."*

**2. Interest rate** (percentage return):
$$
i(0,1) = \frac{V(1) - V(0)}{V(0)} = \frac{1}{100} = 0.01 = 1\%
$$
*"I earned 1% return on my investment."*

**3. Accumulation factor** (how much €1 becomes):
$$
m(0,1) = \frac{V(1)}{V(0)} = \frac{101}{100} = 1.01
$$
*"€1 at time 0 becomes €1.01 at time 1."*

**4. Discount** (same as interest):
$$
D(0,1) = V(1) - V(0) = 1 \text{ euro}
$$

**5. Discount rate** (percentage of future value):
$$
d(0,1) = \frac{V(1) - V(0)}{V(1)} = \frac{1}{101} \approx 0.0099 = 0.99\%
$$
*"The interest represents 0.99% of the future value."*

**6. Discount factor** (what a future €1 is worth today):
$$
v(0,1) = \frac{V(0)}{V(1)} = \frac{100}{101} \approx 0.9901
$$
*"€1 at time 1 is worth €0.9901 today (at time 0)."*

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Notice the Pattern

**Absolute vs. Relative**:

- $i = I/V(0) = 1/100 = 0.01$ (interest rate = interest per unit initial value) ✓
- $d = D/V(1) = 1/101 \approx 0.0099$ (discount rate = discount per unit future value) ✓

**Factor relationships**:

- $m = 1.01 = 1 + i$ (accumulation factor = 1 plus interest rate) ✓
- $v = 1/1.01 \approx 0.9901 = 1/m$ (discount factor = reciprocal of accumulation) ✓
- $d \approx 0.0099 = i/(1+i) = 0.01/1.01$ (discount rate from interest rate) ✓

All relationships check out! From the value function alone, we extracted **six consistent quantities**.
:::

### Interval [2, 4]

**Interest rate**:
$$
i(2,4) = \frac{V(4) - V(2)}{V(2)} = \frac{111-110}{110} = \frac{1}{110} \approx 0.909\%
$$

**Accumulation factor** (how much €1 becomes):
$$
m(2,4) = \frac{V(4)}{V(2)} = \frac{111}{110} \approx 1.00909
$$

::: {.callout-warning icon=true}
## Important Observation

Interest rates **vary across time intervals**! 

- Between years 0-1: rate is 1%
- Between years 2-4: rate is 0.909%

This is why we write $i(t, t+\tau)$ with explicit time dependence. The rate depends on **when** and **for how long** you invest.

## 6. Why This Framework Helps

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Power of the Value Function Framework

**Traditional approach**: Learn interest rates, discount rates, accumulation factors as separate formulas. Memorize relationships.

**Value function approach**:

1. Understand $V(t)$ = the master function describing financial growth
2. Every other quantity is just a **ratio or difference** of $V$ at two time points
3. All relationships follow automatically from this definition

**Benefits**:

1. **Unified understanding**: One concept ($V(t)$) generates everything else
2. **Handles complexity naturally**: Variable rates, multiple periods, different structures all fit seamlessly
3. **Exam superpower**: Forget a formula? Derive it from $V(t)$ on the spot
4. **Deeper insight**: See *why* formulas work, not just *that* they work
5. **Clear separation**: absolute vs relative vs multiplier perspectives

**Bottom line**: Master $V(t)$, and interest rates become different ways of reading the same story.
