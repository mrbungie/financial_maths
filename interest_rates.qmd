# Interest & Discount Rates

## Introduction

Interest rates are the **engine** of financial mathematics. They answer the fundamental question: *"What is the price of time?"* In this chapter, we'll explore how interest rates work, how they relate to discount factors, and how they transform money across time.

## Core Principle: Time Value of Money
**A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow.**

Why? Three main reasons:

1. **Opportunity cost**: Today's dollar can be invested to earn returns
2. **Inflation**: Future dollars have less purchasing power
3. **Risk**: Future payments are uncertain
:::

Interest rates **quantify** this time value: they tell us precisely *how much more* a dollar today is worth compared to a dollar later.

## Two Directions: Accumulation vs. Discount

Think of interest rates as a **bidirectional lens** for viewing money across time:

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## The "Money Lens" Analogy

**ðŸ”­ Accumulation = Telescope (Forward View)**  
Looking into the future: *"If I invest $100 today, how much will I have later?"*  
Answer: **More** (money grows)

**ðŸ”¬ Discount = Microscope (Backward View)**  
Looking back to present: *"If I need $100 in the future, how much should I set aside today?"*  
Answer: **Less** (future dollars are worth less today)

## Accumulation: Growing Money Forward

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Accumulation Factor
The **accumulation factor** $a(t)$ tells you how much $1$ today grows to at time $t$:

$$
a(t) = (1 + i)^t
$$

Where $i$ is the interest rate per period.
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: The Multiplier of Time

Think of the accumulation factor as a **time multiplier** for your money:

- $a(1) = 1.05$ means: "After 1 year at 5%, every dollar becomes 1.05 dollars"
- $a(5) = 1.276$ means: "After 5 years, every dollar becomes 1.276 dollars"
- $a(10) = 1.629$ means: "After 10 years, every dollar becomes 1.629 dollars"

**Real-world parallel**: It's like a "growth multiplier" in a video game. Your money at level 5 is worth 1.276x more than at level 0. The accumulation factor is your XP multiplier!
:::

### Example: Accumulation

**Question**: You invest $1,000$ today at 6\% annual interest. How much will you have in 5 years?

**Solution**:
$$
FV = 1000 \times (1.06)^5 = 1000 \times 1.3382 = \$1,338.20
$$

**Timeline View**:

| Time (years) | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|--------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Amount | $1,000.00 | $1,060.00 | $1,123.60 | $1,191.02 | $1,262.48 | $1,338.23 |
| Growth | â€” | +$60 | +$63.60 | +$67.42 | +$71.46 | +$75.75 |

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Notice
Each year's growth is **larger** than the previous yearâ€”that's **compound interest** at work! You earn interest not just on your original $1,000, but also on previously earned interest.
:::

## Discount: Shrinking Money Backward

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Discount Factor
The **discount factor** $v^t$ tells you how much $1$ at time $t$ is worth today:

$$
v^t = \frac{1}{(1+i)^t}
$$

Alternatively, we can define $v = \frac{1}{1+i}$ (the one-period discount factor), so:

$$
v^t = \left(\frac{1}{1+i}\right)^t
$$
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: The Shrink Ray of Time

The discount factor is like a **"shrink ray"** that makes future money smaller in today's terms:

- $v^1 = 0.952$ means: "A dollar next year is worth 95.2 cents today"
- $v^5 = 0.784$ means: "A dollar in 5 years is worth 78.4 cents today"
- $v^{10} = 0.614$ means: "A dollar in 10 years is worth only 61.4 cents today"

**Why it shrinks**: The further away a payment is, the less it's worth todayâ€”because you lose the opportunity to invest that money and earn interest. Time literally "discounts" the value of future money.

**Key relationship**: Notice $a(t) \times v^t = 1$. They're inverses! Growing forward and shrinking backward cancel out perfectly.
:::

### Example: Discounting

**Question**: You need $1,000$ in 5 years. If the interest rate is 6\%, how much should you set aside today?

**Solution**:
$$
PV = \frac{1000}{(1.06)^5} = \frac{1000}{1.3382} = \$747.26
$$

**Interpretation**: If you invest $747.26$ today at 6\%, it will grow to exactly $1,000$ in 5 years.

### Discount Rate vs. Interest Rate

::: {.callout-important icon=true}
## Key Relationship
For the **same** time value of money:

- **Interest rate** $i$: Used for accumulation (moving forward)
- **Discount rate** $i$: Same rate, used for discounting (moving backward)
- **Discount factor** $v = \frac{1}{1+i}$

They're two sides of the same coin:

$$
(1+i) \times v = (1+i) \times \frac{1}{1+i} = 1
$$

:::

Real-world interest rates come in different flavors depending on **compounding frequency**.

### Effective Annual Rate (EAR)

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Effective Annual Rate
The **effective annual rate** is the actual annual return, accounting for compounding within the year.

If interest is compounded $m$ times per year at rate $i_m$ per period:

$$
\text{EAR} = \left(1 + \frac{i_m}{m}\right)^m - 1
$$
:::

### Example: Quarterly Compounding

**Given**: Bank offers 8\% annual rate, compounded quarterly (4 times/year).

**What's the effective annual rate?**

- Quarterly rate: $i_4 = 8\% / 4 = 2\%$ per quarter
- Effective annual rate:

$$
\text{EAR} = (1.02)^4 - 1 = 1.0824 - 1 = 8.24\%
$$

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Interpretation
Due to compounding, you effectively earn **8.24\%** per year, not just 8\%. The more frequent the compounding, the higher the effective rate.
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: Why More Compounding = More Money

Compounding frequency is like **reinvesting your gains more often**:

**Annual compounding** (once/year):
- Year 1: Earn 8% on $1,000 = $80
- Wait until end of year to reinvest
- Year 2: Earn 8% on $1,080

**Quarterly compounding** (4 times/year):
- Q1: Earn 2% on $1,000 = $20
- **Immediately** reinvest â†’ now have $1,020
- Q2: Earn 2% on $1,020 = $20.40 (more than Q1!)
- Keep reinvesting every 3 months...

The more frequently you reinvest, the sooner your "interest earns interest." That's why quarterly gives you 8.24% vs. 8% annual.

**Extreme case**: Continuous compounding = reinvesting every nanosecond = maximum possible return!
:::

### Compounding Frequency Comparison

For a **nominal rate of 12\%** per year:

| Compounding | Formula | Effective Rate |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Annual | $(1.12)^1 - 1$ | **12.00\%** |
| Semi-annual | $(1.06)^2 - 1$ | **12.36\%** |
| Quarterly | $(1.03)^4 - 1$ | **12.55\%** |
| Monthly | $(1.01)^{12} - 1$ | **12.68\%** |
| Daily | $(1 + 0.12/365)^{365} - 1$ | **12.75\%** |
| Continuous | $e^{0.12} - 1$ | **12.75\%** |

## Continuous Compounding

As compounding becomes more frequent, the effective rate approaches a limit:

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Continuous Compounding
When interest compounds **continuously** (infinitely often), the accumulation formula becomes:

$$
FV = PV \times e^{rt}
$$

Where:
- $e \approx 2.71828$ (Euler's number)
- $r$ = continuously compounded rate
- $t$ = time
:::

### Example: Continuous vs. Annual

**Invest $1,000 at 10\% for 3 years:**

| Compounding | Formula | Future Value |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| Annual | $1000 \times (1.10)^3$ | **$1,331.00** |
| Continuous | $1000 \times e^{0.10 \times 3}$ | **$1,349.86** |

**Difference**: $1,349.86 âˆ’ $1,331.00 = **$18.86** extra from continuous compounding.

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: Continuous Compounding

Continuous compounding is the **theoretical limit** of "reinvest as fast as possible":

- Annual: Reinvest once per year
- Quarterly: Reinvest 4 times per year
- Daily: Reinvest 365 times per year
- **Continuous**: Reinvest *infinitely* often

**Why $e$?** Euler's number $e \approx 2.718$ naturally emerges when you take the limit of $(1 + \frac{r}{n})^n$ as $n \to \infty$. It's the mathematical constant that describes continuous growth.

**Practical use**: Continuous compounding simplifies many financial formulas and is used in derivatives pricing (Black-Scholes formula). It's more of a mathematical convenience than something banks actually use.
:::

## Interest Rate Decomposition

Real-world interest rates have multiple components:

::: {.callout-important icon=true}
## Interest Rate Components

$$
i = r_f + \text{inflation} + \text{risk premium} + \text{liquidity premium}
$$

Where:

- **$r_f$**: Real risk-free rate (time preference)
- **Inflation**: Compensation for loss of purchasing power
- **Risk premium**: Compensation for default risk
- **Liquidity premium**: Compensation for illiquidity
:::

### Example: Corporate Bond Rate

A corporate bond might have:

- Risk-free rate: 2%
- Expected inflation: 3%
- Default risk premium: 2%
- Liquidity premium: 1%

**Total rate**: 2% + 3% + 2% + 1% = **8%**

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: Unpacking the Interest Rate

When you see "8% interest rate," it's not just the "price of time." It's actually **four prices bundled together**:

1. **Real risk-free rate** (2%): The "pure" price of waitingâ€”what you'd charge even with zero inflation and zero risk
2. **Inflation** (3%): Compensation for money losing purchasing powerâ€”"your $100 today buys less in the future"
3. **Risk premium** (2%): Payment for taking on default riskâ€”"what if they don't pay me back?"
4. **Liquidity premium** (1%): Compensation for tying up your moneyâ€”"I can't access this cash for a while"

**Why this matters**: If inflation drops from 3% to 1%, interest rates should drop by ~2%. If default risk increases, rates go up. Interest rates are a barometer of economic conditions!

**NOTE**: For now we are mostly focusing in the risk-free rate, as in an ideal world.

:::

A common cashflow pattern is an **annuity**: equal payments at regular intervals.

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Annuity
An **annuity** is a series of equal payments $C$ made at regular intervals for $n$ periods.

**Present value of an annuity**:

$$
PV = C \times \frac{1 - v^n}{i} = C \times \frac{1 - (1+i)^{-n}}{i}
$$

This is often denoted as $PV = C \times a_{\overline{n}|i}$ where $a_{\overline{n}|i}$ is the annuity factor.
:::

### Example: Mortgage Payment

**You take a $200,000 mortgage at 5\% for 30 years. What's the monthly payment?**

Given:
- $PV = 200,000$
- $i = 5\% / 12 = 0.4167\%$ per month
- $n = 30 \times 12 = 360$ months

Rearranging: $C = PV \times \frac{i}{1 - (1+i)^{-n}}$

$$
C = 200,000 \times \frac{0.004167}{1 - (1.004167)^{-360}} = 200,000 \times 0.00537 = \$1,073.64
$$

**Your monthly payment**: **$1,073.64**

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: What Is an Annuity?

An annuity is the "*equal payments*" special case:

**Without the annuity formula**: You'd need to discount each of 360 payments individually:
$$PV = \frac{C}{1.004167} + \frac{C}{1.004167^2} + \cdots + \frac{C}{1.004167^{360}}$$
That's 360 calculations! ðŸ˜±

**With the annuity formula**: One clean formula:
$$PV = C \times \frac{1-v^{360}}{0.004167}$$
One calculation! ðŸŽ‰

**The magic**: Because all payments are equal, we can use the geometric series formula to collapse 360 terms into one. It's like finding a shortcut through 360 identical rooms.

**Real-world use**: Mortgages, car loans, bonds, pensionsâ€”any time you have equal, regular payments, the annuity formula saves you massive computational work.

## Perpetuity: The Infinite Annuity

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Perpetuity
A **perpetuity** is an annuity that continues forever.

**Present value**:

$$
PV = \frac{C}{i}
$$

As $n \to \infty$, the annuity formula simplifies to this beautifully simple result.
:::

### Example: Preferred Stock

A preferred stock pays $5 per share annually forever. If the required return is 8\%, what's it worth?

$$
PV = \frac{5}{0.08} = \$62.50
$$

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: The Infinite Formula That's Actually Simple

A perpetuity pays **forever**. Sounds complicated, right? But the formula is the *simplest* of all: $PV = C/i$.

**Why so simple?** As payments go further into the future, discounting makes them worth less and less:
- Payment at year 1: $\frac{5}{1.08} = \$4.63$
- Payment at year 10: $\frac{5}{1.08^{10}} = \$2.32$
- Payment at year 50: $\frac{5}{1.08^{50}} = \$0.11$ (almost nothing!)
- Payment at year 100: Essentially $0

Even though payments go on forever, the total value *converges* to a finite number. Payments far in the future are worth so little that they don't matter.

**Mathematical beauty**: When $n \to \infty$, the term $v^n \to 0$, and the annuity formula $\frac{1-v^n}{i}$ simplifies to $\frac{1}{i}$.

**Real examples**: British consols (government bonds with no maturity date), some preferred stocks, and trust funds that pay out forever.
:::

## Summary Table: Key Formulas

| Concept | Formula | Use |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Accumulation** | $FV = PV \times (1+i)^t$ | Growing money forward |
| **Discount** | $PV = FV \times (1+i)^{-t}$ | Bringing money to present |
| **Discount factor** | $v = \frac{1}{1+i}$ | One-period discounting |
| **Effective rate** | $(1 + i_m/m)^m - 1$ | Accounting for compounding |
| **Continuous** | $FV = PV \times e^{rt}$ | Continuous compounding |
| **Annuity PV** | $C \times \frac{1-v^n}{i}$ | Series of equal payments |
| **Perpetuity PV** | $\frac{C}{i}$ | Forever payments |

## Practical Insights

::: {.callout-important icon=true}
## Using the Right Rate

**Always match**:

- **Time period** of cashflows (monthly, annual, etc.)
- **Compounding frequency** of the rate
- **Risk level** (risk-free rate vs. risky rate)

Example: For monthly mortgage payments, use monthly interest rate, not annual.
:::

::: {.callout-warning icon=true}
## Common Mistakes

1. **Mixing rates**: Using annual rate for monthly cashflows
2. **Forgetting compounding**: Treating 6\% semi-annual as 6\% annual
3. **Wrong perspective**: Confusing investor vs. borrower viewpoint
4. **Sign errors**: Getting cashflow directions backward
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: Interest Rate "Flavors"

Interest rates come in different "flavors" depending on what you're doing:

| Rate Type | Symbol | Direction | Use Case |
|-----------|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Interest rate** | $i$ | Growing forward | "How much will I have?" |
| **Discount rate** | $d$ | Shrinking backward | "What's it worth today?" |
| **Accumulation factor** | $m(t,t+\tau)$ | Multiplier forward | "What's the growth multiple?" |
| **Discount factor** | $v(t,t+\tau)$ | Multiplier backward | "What's the present value multiple?" |

**They're all related**: Pick one, and you can derive the others. They're just different ways of measuring the same underlying phenomenon: the time value of money.

**Exam tip**: If you forget a formula, remember the relationships:
- $m = 1 + i$ (accumulation factor is 1 plus interest rate)
- $v = 1/(1+i)$ (discount factor is reciprocal of accumulation)
- $d = 1 - v$ (discount rate measures loss in value)
:::

## Summary

âœ… **Interest rate** $i$ = price of time, quantifies time value of money  
âœ… **Accumulation** (forward) vs. **Discount** (backward) = two directions  
âœ… **Compound interest** = interest on interest (grows exponentially)  
âœ… **Effective rate** accounts for compounding frequency  
âœ… **Continuous compounding** = infinite frequency limit  
âœ… **Annuities** = equal periodic payments (closed-form PV formula)  
âœ… **Perpetuities** = infinite annuities ($PV = C/i$)

## Teacher's Notation: Classical vs. Value Function Approach

::: {.callout-note icon="true"}
## Two Ways to Teach Interest Rates

Your professor connects interest rates to the **value function** $V(t)$, while classical finance teaches standalone formulas. Both approaches describe the same realityâ€”let's see how they connect.
:::

### Classical Approach: Standalone Formulas

Traditional finance courses teach these as separate concepts:

**Interest Rate** (growth rate):
$$
i = \frac{FV - PV}{PV}
$$

**Discount Rate** (shrinkage rate):
$$
d = \frac{FV - PV}{FV}
$$

**Accumulation** (forward compounding):
$$
FV = PV \times (1+i)^t
$$

**Discounting** (backward compounding):
$$
PV = \frac{FV}{(1+i)^t}
$$

**The classical view**: These are independent formulas you memorize for different situations. Growing money? Use FV. Valuing future cashflows? Use PV.

### Teacher's Approach: Everything Flows from $V(t)$

Your professor defines interest and discount rates **in terms of the value function**:

**Accumulation factor from value function**:
$$
m(t, t+\tau) = \frac{V(t+\tau)}{V(t)}
$$

**Interest rate from value function**:
$$
i(t, t+\tau) = \frac{V(t+\tau) - V(t)}{V(t)} = m(t,t+\tau) - 1
$$

**Discount factor from value function**:
$$
v(t, t+\tau) = \frac{V(t)}{V(t+\tau)} = \frac{1}{m(t,t+\tau)}
$$

**Discount rate from value function**:
$$
d(t, t+\tau) = \frac{V(t+\tau) - V(t)}{V(t+\tau)} = 1 - v(t,t+\tau)
$$

**The value function view**: Interest, discount, accumulation, and discounting are all just **different ways of comparing values at different times**. They're all ratios or differences of $V(t)$ at two time points.

### The Bridge: Same Math, Different Perspective

| Concept | Classical Formula | Teacher's Value Function | Relationship |
|---------|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Accumulation** | $(1+i)^t$ | $\frac{V(t)}{V(0)}$ | How much $1 at time 0 grows to at time $t$ |
| **Interest rate** | $i = \frac{FV-PV}{PV}$ | $i = \frac{V(t+\tau)-V(t)}{V(t)}$ | Percentage increase in value |
| **Discount** | $\frac{1}{(1+i)^t}$ | $\frac{V(0)}{V(t)}$ | How much $1 at time $t$ is worth at time 0 |
| **Discount rate** | $d = \frac{FV-PV}{FV}$ | $d = \frac{V(t+\tau)-V(t)}{V(t+\tau)}$ | Percentage decrease when discounting |

### Example: Same Problem, Both Languages

**Scenario**: You invest â‚¬100 today at 10% annual interest. What's it worth in 2 years?

**Classical approach**:
$$
FV = 100 \times (1.10)^2 = 100 \times 1.21 = â‚¬121
$$
**Interest earned**: $121 - 100 = â‚¬21$ â†’ rate = $21/100 = 21\%$ over 2 years

**Value function approach**:
- Start: $V(0) = 100$
- End: $V(2) = 121$
- Accumulation factor: $m(0,2) = V(2)/V(0) = 121/100 = 1.21$
- Interest rate: $i(0,2) = m(0,2) - 1 = 0.21 = 21\%$

**Same answer!** But the value function approach also gives you:
- $V(0.5) = 100 \times (1.10)^{0.5} = 104.88$
- $V(1) = 100 \times (1.10)^{1} = 110.00$
- $V(1.5) = 100 \times (1.10)^{1.5} = 115.37$

The classical approach gives you snapshots (start and end). The value function gives you a **continuous movie** of how your money grows.

### Why Each Approach Is Useful

::: {.callout-important icon="true"}
## When to Use Each Approach

**Use Classical Formulas (FV, PV, $i = (FV-PV)/PV$) when:**
- You need quick, practical calculations
- You're solving textbook problems
- You only care about beginning and end values
- You're communicating with practitioners
- You want computational efficiency

**Use Value Function Framework ($V(t)$, $m(t,t+\tau)$, $i(t,t+\tau)$) when:**
- You need to understand *why* formulas work
- You're analyzing how value evolves continuously over time
- You're dealing with variable interest rates
- You want a unified theoretical framework
- You're comparing different interest rate structures
- You need mathematical rigor for proofs

**On exams**: Use classical formulas for speed unless the question specifically asks about $V(t)$ or the problem requires tracking value at multiple time points.

### Intuition: Why Your Professor Uses $V(t)$

::: {.callout-tip icon="true"}
## The Power of the Unified Framework

**Analogy**: Learning interest rates is like learning about distance and speed:

**Classical approach**: 
- Distance formula: $d = vt$
- Speed formula: $v = d/t$
- Time formula: $t = d/v$

Three separate formulas to memorize.

**Value function approach**:
- One concept: Position function $x(t)$ describes where you are at any time
- Speed is just: $v = \frac{dx}{dt}$ (rate of change of position)
- Everything else follows from this

**Similarly**: $V(t)$ is your "position" in financial space. Interest rates are just the "speed" at which your financial position changes. One framework explains everything.

**Benefits**:
1. **Deeper understanding**: You see *why* $i$ and $d$ are related, not just that they are
2. **Handles complexity**: Variable rates, multiple periods, different decompositions all fit naturally
3. **Mathematical elegance**: One definition ($V(t)$) generates all other concepts
4. **Exam advantage**: If you understand $V(t)$, you can derive any formula you forget

**Bottom line**: Classical formulas are faster for calculations. Value function is better for understanding. Master both!
