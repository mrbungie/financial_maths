## Click to reveal solution

**Key formulas**:
- Interest for period = Outstanding balance at start × interest rate
- Principal repayment = Payment − Interest
- New balance = Old balance − Principal repayment

**Year 1**:
- Interest: $10,000 \times 0.07 = \$700.00$
- Principal: $3,810.52 - 700.00 = \$3,110.52$
- Balance: $10,000 - 3,110.52 = \$6,889.48$

**Year 2**:
- Interest: $6,889.48 \times 0.07 = \$482.26$
- Principal: $3,810.52 - 482.26 = \$3,328.26$
- Balance: $6,889.48 - 3,328.26 = \$3,561.22$

**Year 3**:
- Interest: $3,561.22 \times 0.07 = \$249.29$
- Principal: $3,810.52 - 249.29 = \$3,561.23$ (slight rounding)
- Balance: $3,561.22 - 3,561.22 = \$0.00$

**Completed Table**:

| Year | Payment | Interest | Principal | Outstanding Balance |
|------|---------|----------|-----------|---------------------|
| 0 | — | — | — | 10,000.00 |
| 1 | 3,810.52 | 700.00 | 3,110.52 | 6,889.48 |
| 2 | 3,810.52 | 482.26 | 3,328.26 | 3,561.22 |
| 3 | 3,810.52 | 249.29 | 3,561.23 | 0.00 |

\FloatBarrier

**Key insight**: Notice how interest decreases each year while principal repayment increases—this is typical for fixed-payment loans.

## Exercise 2: Bond Dirty Price

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Problem
You're buying a **US Treasury bond** with the following characteristics:

- **Face value**: $1,000
- **Coupon rate**: 5% annual (paid semi-annually, so $25 every 6 months)
- **Clean price**: Quoted at **98.75** (as % of face value)
- **Last coupon date**: January 15, 2025
- **Settlement date** (purchase date): April 10, 2025
- **Next coupon date**: July 15, 2025
- **Day count convention**: ACT/ACT

**Questions**:
1. Calculate the **accrued interest**
2. Calculate the **dirty price** (what you actually pay)
3. Draw a timeline showing the accrued period

**Related Chapter**: [Bonds](bonds.qmd)
:::

### Solution {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-tip icon=false collapse="true"}
## Click to reveal solution

**Step 1: Count the days**

- Days from Jan 15 to Apr 10:
  - Jan 15 → Jan 31: 16 days
  - February: 28 days (2025 is not a leap year)
  - March: 31 days
  - Apr 1 → Apr 10: 10 days
  - **Total elapsed**: $16 + 28 + 31 + 10 = 85$ days

- Days in full coupon period (Jan 15 → Jul 15):
  - Using same method: 181 days

**Step 2: Calculate accrued interest**

$$
\text{Accrued Interest} = \$25 \times \frac{85}{181} = \$25 \times 0.4696 = \$11.74
$$

**Step 3: Calculate clean price in dollars**

$$
\text{Clean Price} = 98.75\% \times \$1,000 = \$987.50
$$

**Step 4: Calculate dirty price**

$$
\text{Dirty Price} = \$987.50 + \$11.74 = \$999.24
$$

**Timeline**:

```
Jan 15         Apr 10              Jul 15
   |-------------|------------------|
   Last coupon   Purchase           Next coupon
   
   |<-- 85 days -->|<-- 96 days -->|
   (Accrued to seller) (Owned by buyer)
   
   Total period: 181 days
   Accrued fraction: 85/181 = 46.96%
```

**Answers**:
1. Accrued interest: **$11.74**
2. Dirty price: **$999.24**
3. See timeline above

**Key insight**: The seller held the bond for 85/181 ≈ 47% of the coupon period, so they're entitled to about 47% of the $25 coupon payment.

## Exercise 3: Value Function Graphing

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Problem
Consider a simple 3-year investment with the following cashflows:

| Time | Cashflow |
|------|----------|
| 0 | −$5,000 |
| 1 | +$2,000 |
| 2 | +$2,000 |
| 3 | +$2,500 |

Assume an **interest rate of 8%** per year.

**Tasks**:
1. Calculate $V(0)$ (NPV)
2. Calculate $V(1)$ (value at end of year 1)
3. Calculate $V(2)$ (value at end of year 2)
4. Calculate $V(3)$ (value at end of year 3)
5. Sketch the value function $V(t)$ over time
6. Interpret: Is this a good investment?

**Related Chapter**: [Value Function](value_function.qmd)
:::

### Solution {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-tip icon=false collapse="true"}
## Click to reveal solution

**1. Calculate $V(0)$ (NPV)**

$$
\begin{aligned}
V(0) &= -5000 + \frac{2000}{1.08} + \frac{2000}{1.08^2} + \frac{2500}{1.08^3} \\
&= -5000 + 1851.85 + 1714.68 + 1984.25 \\
&= \$550.78
\end{aligned}
$$

**2. Calculate $V(1)$**

Method: Accumulate $V(0)$ one year forward, or equivalently:

$$
\begin{aligned}
V(1) &= (-5000 \times 1.08 + 2000) + \frac{2000}{1.08} + \frac{2500}{1.08^2} \\
&= (-5400 + 2000) + 1851.85 + 2143.35 \\
&= -3400 + 3995.20 \\
&= \$595.20
\end{aligned}
$$

Or: $V(1) = V(0) \times 1.08 = 550.78 \times 1.08 = 594.84$ (slight rounding difference)

**3. Calculate $V(2)$**

$$
\begin{aligned}
V(2) &= [(-5000 \times 1.08 + 2000) \times 1.08 + 2000] + \frac{2500}{1.08} \\
&= (-3400 \times 1.08 + 2000) + 2314.81 \\
&= (-3672 + 2000) + 2314.81 \\
&= -1672 + 2314.81 \\
&= \$642.81
\end{aligned}
$$

**4. Calculate $V(3)$**

$$
\begin{aligned}
V(3) &= [(-5000 \times 1.08 + 2000) \times 1.08 + 2000] \times 1.08 + 2500 \\
&= (-1672 \times 1.08) + 2500 \\
&= -1805.76 + 2500 \\
&= \$694.24
\end{aligned}
$$

**5. Value Function Summary**

| Time | $V(t)$ | Calculation |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 0 | $550.78 | NPV (all cashflows discounted) |
| 1 | $595.20 | After first cashflow + interest |
| 2 | $642.81 | After second cashflow + interest |
| 3 | $694.24 | Final accumulated value |

\FloatBarrier

**Sketch**:

```
V(t)
$700 +                                    * (694)
     |                              * (643)
$600 +                        * (595)
     |                  * (551)
$500 +            /
     |          /
     |        /  
     |      /    Cashflows cause jumps
     |    /      Interest causes smooth growth
     +--+----+----+----+----+----+----+---> Time
        0    1    2    3
```

**6. Interpretation**

- **NPV = $550.78 > 0** → This is a **good investment**!
- The value grows over time (even though we're in negative territory initially)
- By the end, we've earned $694.24 on our $5,000 investment over 3 years
- Effective return: $(694.24/5000)^{1/3} - 1 \approx 4.45\%$ ... wait, this doesn't match our 8% rate!
  
**Wait, let's reconsider**: The final value $V(3) = 694.24$ represents the NPV accumulated forward. The actual final wealth is the sum of all cashflows accumulated:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Final wealth} &= -5000 \times 1.08^3 + 2000 \times 1.08^2 + 2000 \times 1.08 + 2500 \\
&= -6298.56 + 2332.80 + 2160 + 2500 \\
&= \$694.24
\end{aligned}
$$

So $V(3) = \$694.24$ is indeed the profit after all compounding!

**Key insight**: The value function smoothly tracks your financial position over time, growing via interest and jumping at cashflow moments.

## Exercise 4: Compare Day Count Conventions

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Problem
You're analyzing the **accrued interest** on a bond for the period from **March 1, 2025 to August 15, 2025**.

The bond pays a **semi-annual coupon of $30** and uses a **182-day coupon period** (March 1 to August 31).

Calculate the accrued interest (as of August 15) using each of the following conventions:

1. **ACT/ACT** (actual days / actual days in period)
2. **ACT/360** (actual days / 360)
3. **30/360** (assume 30 days per month)

**Questions**:
- Which convention gives the highest accrued interest?
- Why do different conventions exist?

**Related Chapters**: [Bonds](bonds.qmd), [Interest & Discount Rates](interest_rates.qmd)
:::

### Solution {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-tip icon=false collapse="true"}
## Click to reveal solution

**First, count the days**:

**Actual days from March 1 to August 15**:
- March: 31 days (from Mar 1 to Mar 31)
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July: 31 days
- August 1-15: 15 days
- **Total**: $31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 15 = 168$ days

Actually, let's be more careful. From March 1 to August 15:
- March 1 is day 0, March 2 is day 1, etc.
- March: 30 days remaining (Mar 2 through Mar 31)
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July: 31 days
- August 1-15: 15 days
- **Total**: $30 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 15 = 167$ days

**Method 1: ACT/ACT**

$$
\text{AI}_{\text{ACT/ACT}} = \$30 \times \frac{167}{182} = \$30 \times 0.9176 = \$27.53
$$

**Method 2: ACT/360**

Using 360-day year, but actual days elapsed:

$$
\text{AI}_{\text{ACT/360}} = \$30 \times \frac{167}{180} = \$30 \times 0.9278 = \$27.83
$$

Wait, we need to be careful. For ACT/360, we're comparing actual days to a 360-day basis. The coupon period in this convention would be:

March 1 to August 31 = actual days ≈ 184 days, but under 360-day year convention:
- 6 months = $\frac{6}{12} \times 360 = 180$ days

So:
$$
\text{AI}_{\text{ACT/360}} = \$30 \times \frac{167}{180} = \$30 \times 0.9278 = \$27.83
$$

**Method 3: 30/360**

Under 30/360 convention:
- Each month = 30 days
- March 1 to August 15 = 5 full months + 14 days
- Days = $5 \times 30 + 14 = 164$ days
- Full period (March 1 to August 31) = $6 \times 30 = 180$ days

$$
\text{AI}_{30/360} = \$30 \times \frac{164}{180} = \$30 \times 0.9111 = \$27.33
$$

**Summary Table**:

| Convention | Days Elapsed | Days in Period | Accrued Interest |
|------------|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| ACT/ACT | 167 | 182 | **$27.53** |
| ACT/360 | 167 | 180 | **$27.83** |
| 30/360 | 164 | 180 | **$27.33** |

\FloatBarrier

**Answers**:
1. **ACT/360 gives the highest** accrued interest ($27.83)
2. **30/360 gives the lowest** ($27.33)
3. Difference: $27.83 - $27.33 = **$0.50** (about 1.8% difference)

**Why different conventions exist**:
- **Historical**: Before computers, 30/360 made hand calculations easier
- **Market standard**: Different markets evolved different practices
- **ACT/ACT**: Most accurate, used for government bonds
- **30/360**: Simpler, used for corporate bonds
- **ACT/360**: Common in money markets (historical convention)

**Key insight**: Always verify which day count convention applies! The differences can be material for large positions.

## Bonus Exercise: Comprehensive Problem

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Challenge Problem
You're evaluating a **real estate investment**:

- **Purchase price**: $250,000 (today, $t=0$)
- **Rental income**: $1,500/month (assume year-end lump sums: $18,000/year)
- **Expenses**: $4,000/year (maintenance, property tax)
- **Holding period**: 5 years
- **Sale price**: $300,000 (at $t=5$)
- **Required return**: 8% per year

**Tasks**:
1. Calculate the **net annual cashflow** (years 1-4)
2. Calculate the **final year cashflow** (year 5)
3. Calculate the **NPV** of this investment
4. Should you invest? Explain.
5. What sale price at year 5 would make NPV = 0 (break-even)?

**Related Chapters**: [Basic Notions](basic_notions.qmd), [Value Function](value_function.qmd)
:::

### Solution {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-tip icon=false collapse="true"}
## Click to reveal solution

**1. Net annual cashflow (years 1-4)**

$$
\text{Net annual CF} = \text{Rental income} - \text{Expenses} = \$18,000 - \$4,000 = \$14,000
$$

**2. Final year cashflow (year 5)**

$$
\text{Year 5 CF} = \text{Net rental} + \text{Sale proceeds} = \$14,000 + \$300,000 = \$314,000
$$

**3. Calculate NPV**

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{NPV} &= -250,000 + \frac{14,000}{1.08} + \frac{14,000}{1.08^2} + \frac{14,000}{1.08^3} + \frac{14,000}{1.08^4} + \frac{314,000}{1.08^5}
\end{aligned}
$$

Calculate each term:
- Year 1: $14,000 / 1.08 = 12,962.96$
- Year 2: $14,000 / 1.1664 = 12,002.74$
- Year 3: $14,000 / 1.2597 = 11,113.65$
- Year 4: $14,000 / 1.3605 = 10,290.42$
- Year 5: $314,000 / 1.4693 = 213,728.53$

$$
\text{NPV} = -250,000 + 12,963 + 12,003 + 11,114 + 10,290 + 213,729 = \$10,099
$$

**4. Should you invest?**

**Yes!** NPV = $10,099 > 0, meaning this investment creates value. At the required 8% return, you'll earn about $10,000 more than breaking even.

**5. Break-even sale price**

Set NPV = 0 and solve for sale price $S$:

$$
0 = -250,000 + 14,000 \times a_{\overline{4}|8\%} + \frac{S + 14,000}{1.08^5}
$$

First, calculate the PV of years 1-4 rental income:
$$
14,000 \times \frac{1 - 1.08^{-4}}{0.08} = 14,000 \times 3.3121 = 46,369.40
$$

So:
$$
\begin{aligned}
0 &= -250,000 + 46,369 + \frac{S + 14,000}{1.4693} \\
203,631 &= \frac{S + 14,000}{1.4693} \\
S + 14,000 &= 203,631 \times 1.4693 = 299,215 \\
S &= 285,215
\end{aligned}
$$

**Break-even sale price**: **$285,215**

Since the expected sale price ($300,000) exceeds the break-even ($285,215), the investment is attractive.

**Key insight**: Real estate investing involves multiple cashflow streams (rental income, expenses, sale proceeds). NPV analysis helps integrate all these into a single decision metric.
