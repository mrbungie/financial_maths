# Bonds

## Introduction

Bonds are one of the most important financial instruments. Think of a bond as a **formalized loan** with a specific structure: the issuer borrows money from bondholders and promises regular interest payments plus return of principal.

## What Is a Bond?

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Bond
A **bond** is a debt security with the following components:

- **Face Value (Par Value)**: The amount to be repaid at maturity (typically $1,000 or $100)
- **Coupon Rate**: The annual interest rate applied to face value
- **Coupon Payment**: Periodic interest payment (usually semi-annual or annual)
- **Maturity Date**: When the face value is repaid
- **Issue Date**: When the bond is first sold
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: Bond as a Structured Loan
When you buy a bond:

- You're lending money to the issuer (government, corporation)
- The **coupon** is your interest income (like a dividend)
- At **maturity**, you get your principal back
- Unlike stocks, bonds have a **fixed schedule** of payments
:::

## Simple Bond Example

Let's start with a basic 3-year bond:

- **Face Value**: $1,000
- **Coupon Rate**: 5% per year
- **Coupon Frequency**: Annual
- **Maturity**: 3 years

### Cashflow Table (Bondholder's Perspective)

| Time (years) | Coupon Payment | Principal Repayment | Total Cashflow | Description |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|----------------|-------------|
| 0 | — | —1,000 | −1,000 | Purchase bond |
| 1 | +50 | 0 | +50 | First coupon |
| 2 | +50 | 0 | +50 | Second coupon |
| 3 | +50 | +1,000 | +1,050 | Final coupon + principal |

**Calculation**: Annual coupon = Face Value × Coupon Rate = $1,000 × 5\% = $50$

## Clean Price vs. Dirty Price

When bonds are traded between coupon payment dates, we need to account for **accrued interest**.

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definitions

**Clean Price (Quoted Price)**: The market price *excluding* accrued interest. This is what you see quoted.

**Dirty Price (Invoice Price)**: The actual amount paid = Clean Price + Accrued Interest

**Accrued Interest**: Interest earned from the last coupon date to the settlement date, owed to the seller
:::

### Why Accrued Interest?

Imagine you buy a bond halfway through a coupon period:

- The seller held the bond for half the period → earned half the coupon
- You'll receive the *full* coupon on the payment date
- **Fair solution**: You pay the seller for the interest they earned but won't receive

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: "Rent" for the Time Period
Think of accrued interest as rent for the portion of the coupon period the seller held the bond. They earned that interest; you're compensating them since you'll collect the full coupon.
:::

## Visualizing Accrued Interest

Let's say you buy a bond 4 months into a 12-month coupon period (4/12 = 1/3 of the period elapsed).

## Calculating Accrued Interest

::: {.callout-important icon=true}
## Key Formula: Accrued Interest

$$
\text{Accrued Interest} = \text{Coupon Payment} \times \frac{\text{Days since last coupon}}{\text{Days in coupon period}}
$$

Or equivalently:

$$
AI = C \times \frac{d}{D}
$$

where:
- $C$ = coupon payment
- $d$ = days elapsed since last coupon
- $D$ = total days in the coupon period
:::

### Day Count Conventions

The "days" calculation depends on the **day count convention**:

| Convention | Days in Year | Coupon Period Calculation | Used For |
|------------|--------------|---------------------------|----------|
| **ACT/ACT** | Actual (365 or 366) | Actual days in period | US Treasury bonds |
| **ACT/360** | 360 | Actual days in period | Corporate bonds, loans |
| **30/360** | 360 | Assume 30 days per month | Corporate bonds |

::: {.callout-warning icon=true}
## Common Pitfall
Always check which day count convention applies! The same bond can have different accrued interest depending on the convention used.
:::

### Example Calculation

**Given**:
- Semi-annual bond (6-month coupons)
- Coupon = $30
- Last coupon date: January 15
- Purchase date: April 15
- Convention: ACT/ACT

**Calculation**:
- Days elapsed: Jan 15 → Apr 15 = 90 days (actual count)
- Days in period: Jan 15 → Jul 15 = 181 days (actual)
- Accrued Interest = $30 × (90/181) = **$14.92**

## Bond Pricing: Clean vs. Dirty in Action

Let's see a complete transaction:

### Market Scenario

- **Bond**: 5-year Treasury, 4\% annual coupon, $1,000 face value
- **Quoted (Clean) Price**: 98.50 (meaning 98.5\% of face value)
- **Last coupon date**: 3 months ago
- **Next coupon**: In 9 months
- **Convention**: ACT/ACT

### Step 1: Calculate Clean Price in Dollars

$$
\text{Clean Price} = 98.50\% \times \$1,000 = \$985.00
$$

### Step 2: Calculate Accrued Interest

$$
\text{Annual Coupon} = 4\% \times \$1,000 = \$40
$$

$$
\text{Accrued Interest} = \$40 \times \frac{3\text{ months}}{12\text{ months}} = \$40 \times 0.25 = \$10.00
$$

### Step 3: Calculate Dirty Price

$$
\text{Dirty Price} = \$985.00 + \$10.00 = \$995.00
$$

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## What You Actually Pay
You would write a check for **\$995.00**, even though the bond is quoted at "98.50." The difference is the seller's compensation for the 3 months of interest they earned.
:::

## Zero-Coupon Bonds

Not all bonds pay coupons!

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Zero-Coupon Bond
A **zero-coupon bond** makes no periodic interest payments. Instead, it's sold at a discount and redeemed at face value at maturity.
:::

### Example: 5-Year Zero

- **Face Value**: $1,000
- **Purchase Price**: $783.53
- **Maturity**: 5 years
- **Implied Return**: 5\% per year

### Cashflow Table

| Time | Cashflow | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 0 | −783.53 | Purchase at discount |
| 5 | +1,000.00 | Receive face value |

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: All Interest at Once
Instead of receiving small interest payments each year, you receive all the interest at maturity in the form of the difference between purchase price and face value ($1,000 − $783.53 = $216.47).
:::

## Bond Types Summary

| Type | Coupons? | Example | Key Feature |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Fixed-Rate** | Yes, fixed | US Treasury | Predictable income |
| **Zero-Coupon** | No | STRIPS | Bought at discount |
| **Floating-Rate** | Yes, variable | Some corporate | Coupon adjusts with rates |
| **Callable** | Yes | Municipal bonds | Issuer can repay early |

## Practical Insights

::: {.callout-important icon=true}
## Why Clean vs. Dirty Matters

**For traders**: Clean price shows the bond's "true" value independent of when you buy it in the coupon cycle.

**For investors**: Dirty price is what matters for your cashflow—it's what you actually pay or receive.

**For comparison**: Clean prices make it easy to compare bonds without worrying about coupon timing.
:::

## Summary

✅ **Bonds** = structured debt with fixed schedules  
✅ **Coupons** = periodic interest payments  
✅ **Face Value** = principal repaid at maturity  
✅ **Clean Price** = quoted price (excludes accrued interest)  
✅ **Dirty Price** = actual payment (includes accrued interest)  
✅ **Accrued Interest** = seller's compensation for partial period  
✅ **Day Count Conventions** = critical for accurate calculations
