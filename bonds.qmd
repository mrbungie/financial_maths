# Bonds

## Introduction

Bonds are one of the most important financial instruments. Think of a bond as a **formalized loan** with a specific structure: the issuer borrows money from bondholders and promises regular interest payments plus return of principal.

## Definition: Bond
A **bond** is a debt security with the following components:

- **Face Value (Par Value)**: The amount to be repaid at maturity (typically $1,000 or $100)
- **Coupon Rate**: The annual interest rate applied to face value
- **Coupon Payment**: Periodic interest payment (usually semi-annual or annual)
- **Maturity Date**: When the face value is repaid
- **Issue Date**: When the bond is first sold
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: Bond as a Structured Loan
When you buy a bond:

- You're lending money to the issuer (government, corporation)
- The **coupon** is your interest income (like a dividend)
- At **maturity**, you get your principal back
- Unlike stocks, bonds have a **fixed schedule** of payments
:::

## Simple Bond Example

Let's start with a basic 3-year bond:

- **Face Value**: $1,000
- **Coupon Rate**: 5% per year
- **Coupon Frequency**: Annual
- **Maturity**: 3 years

### Cashflow Table (Bondholder's Perspective)

| Time (years) | Cashflow | Description |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| 0 | −1,000 | Purchase bond |
| 1 | +50 | First coupon |
| 2 | +50 | Second coupon |
| 3 | +1,050 | Final coupon + face value |

**Calculation**: Annual coupon = Face Value × Coupon Rate = $1,000 × 5\% = $50$

At maturity (Year 3), you receive both the final coupon ($50) and the face value ($1,000) for a total of $1,050.

When bonds are traded between coupon payment dates, we need to account for **accrued interest**.

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definitions

**Clean Price (Quoted Price)**: The market price *excluding* accrued interest. This is what you see quoted.

**Dirty Price (Invoice Price)**: The actual amount paid = Clean Price + Accrued Interest

**Accrued Interest**: Interest earned from the last coupon date to the settlement date, owed to the seller
:::

### Why Accrued Interest?

Imagine you buy a bond halfway through a coupon period:

- The seller held the bond for half the period → earned half the coupon
- You'll receive the *full* coupon on the payment date
- **Fair solution**: You pay the seller for the interest they earned but won't receive

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: "Rent" for the Time Period
Think of accrued interest as rent for the portion of the coupon period the seller held the bond. They earned that interest; you're compensating them since you'll collect the full coupon.
:::

## Visualizing Accrued Interest

Let's say you buy a bond 4 months into a 12-month coupon period (4/12 = 1/3 of the period elapsed).

## Calculating Accrued Interest

::: {.callout-important icon=true}
## Key Formula: Accrued Interest

$$
\text{Accrued Interest} = \text{Coupon Payment} \times \frac{\text{Days since last coupon}}{\text{Days in coupon period}}
$$

Or equivalently:

$$
AI = C \times \frac{d}{D}
$$

where:
- $C$ = coupon payment
- $d$ = days elapsed since last coupon
- $D$ = total days in the coupon period
:::

### Day Count Conventions

The "days" calculation depends on the **day count convention**:

| Convention | Days in Year | Coupon Period Calculation | Used For |
|------------|--------------|---------------------------|----------|
| **ACT/ACT** | Actual (365 or 366) | Actual days in period | US Treasury bonds |
| **ACT/360** | 360 | Actual days in period | Corporate bonds, loans |
| **30/360** | 360 | Assume 30 days per month | Corporate bonds |

\FloatBarrier

::: {.callout-warning icon=true}
## Common Pitfall
Always check which day count convention applies! The same bond can have different accrued interest depending on the convention used.
:::

### Example Calculation

**Given**:

- Semi-annual bond (6-month coupons)
- Coupon = $30
- Last coupon date: January 15
- Purchase date: April 15
- Convention: ACT/ACT

```

\FloatBarrier

#### Step-by-Step Calculation

**Step 1: Count the days**

- Days elapsed: Jan 15 → Apr 15 = **90 days** (actual count)
- Days in period: Jan 15 → Jul 15 = **181 days** (actual)

**Step 2: Calculate accrued interest**

$$
\text{Accrued Interest} = \$30 \times \frac{90}{181} = \$30 \times 0.4972 = \$14.92
$$

**Step 3: Price components**

Assume the bond's clean price is quoted at **98.50** (per $100 face value):

```{=latex}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9]
% Clean price box
\draw[thick,fill=blue!20] (0,0) rectangle (3.5,1.8);
\node[align=center,font=\bfseries] at (1.75,1.2) {Clean Price};
\node[align=center] at (1.75,0.6) {\$98.50};

% Plus sign
\node[font=\Huge] at (4.5,0.9) {+};

% Accrued interest box
\draw[thick,fill=orange!30] (5.5,0) rectangle (9,1.8);
\node[align=center,font=\bfseries] at (7.25,1.2) {Accrued Interest};
\node[align=center] at (7.25,0.6) {\$14.92};
\node[align=center,font=\tiny] at (7.25,0.2) {(90/181 of \$30)};

% Equals sign
\node[font=\Huge] at (4.5,-1.5) {=};

% Dirty price box (wider)
\draw[thick,fill=purple!20] (1,-2.8) rectangle (8,-1.2);
\node[align=center,font=\bfseries\large] at (4.5,-1.7) {Dirty Price (What You Pay)};
\node[align=center,font=\large] at (4.5,-2.3) {\$113.42};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
```

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Interpretation
The seller held the bond for 90/181 ≈ **49.7%** of the coupon period, so they receive about half of the $30 coupon payment. You'll collect the full $30 coupon on July 15, but you compensate the seller for the portion they earned.

## Bond Pricing: Clean vs. Dirty in Action

Let's work through a complete real-world bond transaction. Imagine you're buying an Italian Treasury bond (BTP) from another investor in the secondary market. The bond was issued some time ago and has been paying regular coupons. When you buy it between coupon dates, you need to understand both the **quoted price** (what you see in the market) and the **actual price** (what you'll pay).

This example demonstrates why clean and dirty prices matter in practice—the quoted price doesn't tell the full story!

### Market Scenario

Consider the Italian treasury bond **"Btp-1mg31 6%"**:

- **Bond**: Italian BTP with maturity 1/5/31
- **Issued**: Above par at €102.40
- **Coupon rate**: $i_C = 3\%$ semi-annual (starting 1/11/99)
- **Convention**: ACT/ACT
- **Last coupon date**: 1/5/2025
- **Quote date**: 24 September 2025
- **Quoted (Clean) Price**: €116.36 on Milan Stock Exchange

**Question**: How much should we pay for this bond?

### Step 1: Identify the Clean Price

The clean price is what's quoted on the Milan Stock Exchange:

$$
\text{Clean Price (Q)} = \text{\texteuro} 116.36
$$

This is what you see in the market quote—but it's **not** what you'll actually pay!

### Step 2: Calculate Accrued Interest

Since the last coupon was paid on 1/5/2025, we need to calculate how many days have elapsed until 24/9/2025:

**Days elapsed**: 1 May → 24 September = **146 days** (actual count)

The semi-annual coupon payment is €3.00 (half of the 6% annual coupon on €100 face value).

Since this is a **semi-annual** bond, the period is approximately 180 days (half a year). Using the ACT/180 approximation:

$$
A = 3 \times \frac{146}{180} = 3 \times 0.8111 = \text{\texteuro} 2.43
$$

More precisely, using ACT/ACT with actual days in the period (1 May to 1 Nov = 184 days):

$$
A = 3 \times \frac{146}{184} = 3 \times 0.7935 = \text{\texteuro} 2.38
$$

### Step 3: Calculate Dirty Price

The **dirty price** is what you actually pay—it includes both components:

$$
P = Q + A = 116.36 + 2.38 = \text{\texteuro} 118.74
$$

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## What You Actually Pay

You would pay **€118.74**, even though the bond is quoted at €116.36.

**Why the difference?** The seller held the bond for 146 days (about 79% of the 184-day semi-annual period) and earned €2.38 of interest during that time. Since you'll receive the full €3.00 coupon on 1 November 2025, you compensate them now for the portion they earned. This ensures fair pricing regardless of when the trade occurs within the coupon period.

**Key insight**: Always ask for the **dirty price** when evaluating the true cost of a bond purchase!

## Zero-Coupon Bonds

Not all bonds pay coupons!

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Zero-Coupon Bond
A **zero-coupon bond** makes no periodic interest payments. Instead, it's sold at a discount and redeemed at face value at maturity.
:::

### Example: 5-Year Zero

- **Face Value**: $1,000
- **Purchase Price**: $783.53
- **Maturity**: 5 years
- **Implied Return**: 5\% per year

### Cashflow Table

| Time | Cashflow | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 0 | −783.53 | Purchase at discount |
| 5 | +1,000.00 | Receive face value |

\FloatBarrier

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: All Interest at Once
Instead of receiving small interest payments each year, you receive all the interest at maturity in the form of the difference between purchase price and face value ($1,000 − $783.53 = $216.47).
:::

## Bond Types Summary

| Type | Coupons? | Example | Key Feature |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Fixed-Rate** | Yes, fixed | US Treasury | Predictable income |
| **Zero-Coupon** | No | STRIPS | Bought at discount |
| **Floating-Rate** | Yes, variable | Some corporate | Coupon adjusts with rates |
| **Callable** | Yes | Municipal bonds | Issuer can repay early |

## Practical Insights

::: {.callout-important icon=true}
## Why Clean vs. Dirty Matters

**For traders**: Clean price shows the bond's "true" value independent of when you buy it in the coupon cycle.

**For investors**: Dirty price is what matters for your cashflow—it's what you actually pay or receive.

**For comparison**: Clean prices make it easy to compare bonds without worrying about coupon timing.
:::

## Summary

✅ **Bonds** = structured debt with fixed schedules  
✅ **Coupons** = periodic interest payments  
✅ **Face Value** = principal repaid at maturity  
✅ **Clean Price** = quoted price (excludes accrued interest)  
✅ **Dirty Price** = actual payment (includes accrued interest)  
✅ **Accrued Interest** = seller's compensation for partial period  
✅ **Day Count Conventions** = critical for accurate calculations

**Next**: In [Chapter 3: Value Function](value_function.qmd), we'll learn how to value entire cashflow streams over time.
