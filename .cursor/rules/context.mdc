- Use docs/information to understand the source materials.
- When writing about a new idea, include a box for references that includes a book and a slide reference. For locating references use docs/resource_index/slides.md and docs/resource_index/book.md. It may be possible something has no source material, in which case you can just point to the source material as "source material not available for this idea".
- Reference boxes should use the purple/lavender callout-caution style and be formatted as:

```
::: {.callout-caution icon=true}
## References

**Book:** NAME, Page NUMBER, [Direct Link](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mrbungie/financial_maths@main/resources/books/pearson_corporate_finance_6th.pdf#page=NUMBER)

**Slide:** NAME, Page NUMBER, [Direct Link](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mrbungie/financial_maths@main/resources/slideshows/25_09_30_FinancialMathematics_Slides_1_96.pdf#page=NUMBER)

**Other:** Additional sources (only when directed by the programmer)
:::
```
- DO NOTE THAT BOOK PAGES ARE 33 PAGES OFFSET BY 100 FROM THE ACTUAL PAGE NUMBER. i.e. page 100 in the book is page 133 in the pdf, page 101 in the book is page 134 in the pdf, etc. SO MAKE SURE TO CORRECT FOR THIS WHEN PROVIDING PAGE NUMBERS, ALWAYS POINT THE PDF PAGE NOT THE REFERENCE INDEX PAGE.
- The reference box uses a distinct purple/lavender color scheme to differentiate it from other callout boxes (note, tip, important, warning)
- Always include clickable direct links to the exact page in the source material using the format above
