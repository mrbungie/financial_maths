# Value Function

## Introduction

So far, we've learned to describe cashflows as discrete events (money at specific times). But to truly understand the **financial state** of a project or investment at *any* point in time, we need a continuous view. This is where the **value function** comes in.

## Intuition: From Snapshots to a Movie

-   **Cashflow table**: Snapshots at specific moments
-   **Value function**: A continuous movie showing your financial position over time

Think of it as tracking your "net worth from this investment" at every instant, not just when money moves.

NOTE: There is nothing about "Value Function" in the book itself, as it is a more complex abstraction than the ones normally used in Finance. It is actually useful notation if you get it (i.e. your background is in engineering, statistics, math, etc), but **just don't bother looking it up online.**

## Definition: Value Function

The **value function** $V(t)$ represents the monetary value of a cashflow stream at time $t$, accounting for all past and future cashflows, adjusted for the time value of money.

$$
V(t) = \text{value at time } t \text{ of everything that has happened and will happen}
$$
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon="true"}
## Intuition: Your Investment's "Bank Balance"

Think of $V(t)$ as the balance in a virtual bank account that tracks your investment:

- At $t=0$: You make your initial investment → $V(0)$ shows starting balance
- As time passes: Interest accrues, payments come in/go out → $V(t)$ shows current "net worth"
- At maturity: All payments are settled → $V(T)$ shows final accumulated value

**Key insight**: Unlike your actual cashflows (which only happen at specific times), $V(t)$ exists at *every* moment in time. It's a smooth, continuous function that tells you "if I liquidated everything right now, what would I have?"
:::

### Two Perspectives on $V(t)$

1.  **Backward-looking**: What happened before $t$, accumulated to time $t$
2.  **Forward-looking**: What will happen after $t$, discounted to time $t$

## Value Function and Cash Flows: A Detailed Example

::: {.callout-note icon="true"}
## Important Distinction

The **value function** of a financial transaction and its **cash flows** are two different concepts. To see this clearly, let's examine an investment/borrowing operation in detail.
:::

### The Investment Operation

Consider the following financial transaction representing either an investment or borrowing operation:

$$
\{1000, -380, -380, -380\} / \{0, 1, 2, 3\}
$$

This means:
-   **t = 0**: Receive or invest 1,000€
-   **t = 1**: Pay 380€
-   **t = 2**: Pay 380€  
-   **t = 3**: Pay 380€

### Cashflow Table

| Time (quarters) | Cashflow (€) | Type    | Description |
|-----------------|--------------|---------|-------------|
| 0               | +1,000       | Inflow  | Loan received / Investment |
| 1               | −380         | Outflow | Payment     |
| 2               | −380         | Outflow | Payment     |
| 3               | −380         | Outflow | Payment     |

## Interpretation

If you **receive** 1,000€ initially, this is a **borrowing** operation (you're taking a loan).  
If you **invest** 1,000€ initially, think of the negative sign meaning you place money, and the positive payments are your returns.

For this example, we'll treat it as a **borrowing operation** where you borrow 1,000€ and make three payments of 380€.
:::

### Decomposing the Interest

Let's suppose that interest is described by **Decomposition 1**, with the cashflows decomposed as:

$$
\{1000, -333.33-46.67, -333.33-46.67, -333.34-46.66\} / \{0, 1, 2, 3\}
$$

This decomposition separates each payment into **principal repayment** and **interest payment**:

| Time | Total Payment (€) | Principal (€) | Interest (€) |
|------|-------------------|---------------|--------------|
| 0    | +1,000            | —             | —            |
| 1    | −380              | −333.33       | −46.67       |
| 2    | −380              | −333.33       | −46.67       |
| 3    | −380              | −333.34       | −46.66       |

\FloatBarrier

For the sake of brevity, let's measure time in **quarters**, starting from 31/12/2024. From this decomposition, we can compute the following **period interest rates**:

$$
i_1 = 0.047; \quad i_2 = 0.070; \quad i_3 = 0.140
$$

::: {.callout-note icon="true"}
## Computing Period Interest Rates

The period interest rate $i_k$ represents the interest accrued during period $k$:

- **Period 1**: Interest = 46.67€ on 1,000€ principal → $i_1 = 46.67/1000 = 0.047$
- **Period 2**: Interest = 46.67€ on 1,000€ principal → $i_2 = 0.070$ (needs accumulated capital)
- **Period 3**: Interest = 46.66€ on accumulated capital → $i_3 = 0.140$
:::

### Building the Value Function

We can now use these rates to build a **composite operation** of the same type we've used to introduce the value function.

#### At Time 0: Initial Investment

The investment consists of 1,000€ at time 0. Therefore:

$$
V(0) = 1,000
$$

#### At Time 1: After First Period

At time 1, since the period interest rate is $i_1 = 0.047$, the period interest is 46.67€. The borrower can decide to **repay the entire debt**, or to **extend the payment** term by another quarter, paying an additional interest.

If they choose the **second option**, the composite transaction becomes:

$$
\{1,000, -1,046.67\} / \{1, 046.67, -1,046.67 + I_2\}
$$

Now, what is the interest pertaining to the second period? To preserve coherence with interest rate $i_2$, it must be:

$$
I_2 = 1,046.67 \times i_2 = 73.27
$$

Therefore, the composite transaction becomes:

$$
\{1,000, -1,046.67\} / \{0, 1\} \oplus \{1,046.67, -1,119.43\} / \{0, 1\}
$$

The symbol $\oplus$ means we're **combining** or **composing** these operations. We now have the second point of the value function:

$$
V(0) = 1,000; \quad V(1) = 1,046.67
$$

#### At Time 2 and 3: Continuing the Process

We can **repeat the same procedure**: holding the period interest rates fixed and supposing to delay the principal payment until time 3, we find the remaining points of the value function:

$$
V(2) = 1,119.93; \quad V(3) = 1,276.72
$$

## Reading the Graph

-   **The value function grows over time** — the debt accumulates with interest
-   Starting from 1,000€, it grows to 1,276.72€ by time 3
-   The growth rate **accelerates** over time (notice $i_3 = 0.140$ is much higher than $i_1 = 0.047$)
-   This represents the **accumulated capital** if no payments are made
:::

### Comparing with Decomposition 2

What happens if we repeat the same procedure using **Decomposition 2**?

$$
\{1000, -370-10, -370-10, -260-120\} / \{0, 1, 2, 3\}
$$

This alternative decomposition has a **different structure** of principal and interest:

| Time | Total Payment (€) | Principal (€) | Interest (€) |
|------|-------------------|---------------|--------------|
| 0    | +1,000            | —             | —            |
| 1    | −380              | −370          | −10          |
| 2    | −380              | −370          | −10          |
| 3    | −380              | −260          | −120         |

\FloatBarrier

Notice that in Decomposition 2, **more principal is paid early**, but the **interest in period 3 is much higher** (120€ vs 46.66€).

From this decomposition, we compute different period interest rates:

$$
i_1 = 0.010; \quad i_2 = 0.016; \quad i_3 = 0.462
$$

Following the same procedure as before, we obtain:

$$
V(0) = 1,000; \quad V(1) = 1,010; \quad V(2) = 1,026.16; \quad V(3) = 1,500.25
$$

## Key Observations

Comparing the two decompositions:

1. **Both start at the same point**: $V(0) = 1,000$ for both
2. **Decomposition 1** (red): Grows steadily with moderate interest rates
   - More balanced growth across all periods
   - Final value: 1,276.72€
3. **Decomposition 2** (blue): Grows slowly at first, then dramatically in period 3
   - Very low interest rates in periods 1 and 2
   - Extremely high interest rate in period 3 ($i_3 = 0.462$ or 46.2%!)
   - Final value: 1,500.25€ (much higher!)

**Same cashflows, different interest rate structures** lead to different value functions!
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon="true"}
## Intuition: Why Different Value Functions?

Imagine two credit cards with the same minimum payments but different interest structures:

- **Card 1** (Decomposition 1): Charges steady 4-14% interest across all periods → predictable debt growth
- **Card 2** (Decomposition 2): Charges low 1-2% initially, then BAM! 46% in the final period → balloon debt

Both have identical payment schedules, but the *timing* of when interest compounds creates vastly different financial realities. This is why reading the fine print matters—the payment schedule alone doesn't tell the whole story!

**Financial lesson**: Two loans with identical cashflows can have completely different "financial health trajectories" depending on how interest is structured over time.
:::

## The Value Function Formula

::: {.callout-important icon="true"}
## Key Formula: Value Function

For a cashflow stream with payments $C_0, C_1, ..., C_n$ at times $t_0, t_1, ..., t_n$:

$$
V(t) = \sum_{t_i \leq t} C_i \cdot (1+i)^{t-t_i} + \sum_{t_j > t} \frac{C_j}{(1+i)^{t_j - t}}
$$

Where: 

- First sum: Past cashflows accumulated forward to time $t$ 
- Second sum: Future cashflows discounted back to time $t$ 
- $i$ = interest rate per period

NOTE: $\sum$ means summation. You can read more about that in the maths cheat sheet.
:::

**In words**: Value at time $t$ = (Everything before $t$, grown with interest) + (Everything after $t$, discounted)

::: {.callout-tip icon="true"}
## Intuition: The Value Function Formula

The value function formula has two "modes":

**🔭 Looking backward** (first sum): "I already received/paid these amounts. If I'd invested them at rate $i$, they'd be worth..." → Accumulate past cashflows forward

**🔬 Looking forward** (second sum): "I know I'll receive/pay these amounts later. In today's money, they're worth..." → Discount future cashflows backward

**At any time $t$, you stand at the dividing line**: everything behind you has been growing with interest, everything ahead of you needs to be discounted. The sum gives you your current financial position.

**Example**: Standing at year 2 of a 5-year project:

- Years 0-2 cashflows: Already happened → accumulate to year 2
- Years 3-5 cashflows: Still coming → discount to year 2
- Your position at year 2 = sum of both

## Net Present Value (NPV)

:::

The value at time zero, $V(0)$, has a special name:

::: {.callout-note icon="true"}
## Definition: Net Present Value

The **Net Present Value (NPV)** is the value function evaluated at $t=0$:

$$
\text{NPV} = V(0) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \frac{C_i}{(1+r)^{t_i}}
$$

It represents the "today value" of the entire cashflow stream.
:::

### Decision Rule

::: {.callout-important icon="true"}
## NPV Decision Rule

-   **NPV \> 0**: Project adds value → **Accept**
-   **NPV = 0**: Project is break-even → **Indifferent**
-   **NPV \< 0**: Project destroys value → **Reject**
:::

### Example: Should We Accept This Investment?

**Investment opportunity**:

- Initial cost: \$5,000
- Year 1 return: \$2,000
- Year 2 return: \$2,500
- Year 3 return: \$1,800
- Discount rate: 10%

**Calculate NPV**:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{NPV} &= -5000 + \frac{2000}{1.10} + \frac{2500}{1.10^2} + \frac{1800}{1.10^3} \\
&= -5000 + 1818.18 + 2066.12 + 1352.42 \\
&= 236.72
\end{aligned}
$$

**Decision**: **Accept!** NPV = $236.72$ \> 0, so the project adds value.

::: {.callout-tip icon="true"}
## Intuition: Why NPV = V(0)?

NPV is just a special name for the value function at time zero:

- **V(0)**: "What's my financial position *right now* if I commit to this entire project?"
- **NPV**: Same question, different name, used specifically for investment decisions

Think of it as a "today snapshot" of the entire project's worth. If NPV > 0, the project is worth more than it costs today → good deal! If NPV < 0, you're paying more than it's worth → bad deal.

**Why time zero?** Because that's when you make the decision. You need to know: "If I start this project today, does it create or destroy value?"
:::

## Value Function Properties

### Property 1: Additivity

If you have two independent cashflow streams $A$ and $B$:

$$
V_{A+B}(t) = V_A(t) + V_B(t)
$$

You can value them separately and add the results.

### Property 2: Time Consistency

The value function satisfies:

$$
V(t_2) = V(t_1) \cdot (1+i)^{t_2-t_1} + \sum_{t_1 < t_i \leq t_2} C_i \cdot (1+i)^{t_2-t_i}
$$

**Interpretation**: Value at $t_2$ = (Value at $t_1$ grown with interest) + (Cashflows in between, accumulated)

### Property 3: Boundary Conditions

-   **At start**: $V(0)$ = NPV
-   **At end**: $V(T)$ = all cashflows accumulated to final time

## Practical Applications

### 1. Project Monitoring

Track $V(t)$ over time to see if your project is on track:

### 2. Comparing Investments

Two projects with different cashflow patterns:

| Time | Project A | Project B |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| 0    | −1,000    | −1,000    |
| 1    | +1,200    | 0         |
| 2    | 0         | +1,300    |

**At 10% discount rate**: - $\text{NPV}_A = -1000 + 1200/1.10 = 90.91$ - $\text{NPV}_B = -1000 + 1300/1.10^2 = 74.38$

**Conclusion**: Project A is better (higher NPV).

## Lizzi's Notation: Bridging Two Worlds

::: {.callout-note icon="true"}
## Two Ways to Think About Financial Mathematics

Lizzi uses **value function notation** $V(t)$, while most textbooks use **classical formulas** (PV, FV, NPV). They're saying the same thing, just in different languages. Here's how they connect:
:::

### Classical Approach (Traditional Finance)

In most finance courses, you learn these standalone formulas:

**Present Value:**
$$
PV = \frac{C_1}{(1+i)} + \frac{C_2}{(1+i)^2} + \cdots + \frac{C_n}{(1+i)^n}
$$

**Future Value:**
$$
FV = C_0 \cdot (1+i)^n
$$

**Net Present Value:**
$$
NPV = -C_0 + \frac{C_1}{(1+i)} + \frac{C_2}{(1+i)^2} + \cdots + \frac{C_n}{(1+i)^n}
$$

**The classical view**: You have separate formulas for moving money forward (FV) or backward (PV). NPV is a special application of PV for investment decisions.

### Lizzi's Approach (Value Function)

Lizzi introduces **one unified framework** that encompasses all of these:

$$
V(t) = \sum_{t_i \leq t} C_i \cdot (1+i)^{t-t_i} + \sum_{t_j > t} \frac{C_j}{(1+i)^{t_j - t}}
$$

**The value function view**: At any time $t$, you can compute the "value" by accumulating past cashflows forward and discounting future cashflows backward.

### The Bridge: Connecting Both Approaches

| Classical Formula | Value Function Equivalent | Key Distinction |
|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **PV** | $V(0)$ excluding initial cost | Present value = discounted future cashflows only |
| **FV** | $V(T)$ | Future value = value function at final time T |
| **NPV** | $V(0)$ including all cashflows | NPV = Net present value (includes initial investment) |

**Key insight**: The classical formulas are just **special cases** of the value function:
- **PV** is typically the present value of *future* cashflows only (excluding initial cost)
- **NPV** is $V(t)$ evaluated at $t=0$, including *all* cashflows (initial investment + future cashflows)
- **Relationship**: NPV = -Initial Cost + PV, or equivalently, NPV = $V(0)$ with all cashflows
- **FV** is $V(t)$ evaluated at $t=T$ (final time)
- The value function generalizes these to **any** time $t$

## PV vs NPV: The Key Difference

**PV (Present Value)**: Only the present value of *future* cashflows
$$
PV = \frac{C_1}{(1+i)} + \frac{C_2}{(1+i)^2} + \cdots + \frac{C_n}{(1+i)^n}
$$

**NPV (Net Present Value)**: Includes the initial investment/cost
$$
NPV = -C_0 + PV = -C_0 + \frac{C_1}{(1+i)} + \frac{C_2}{(1+i)^2} + \cdots + \frac{C_n}{(1+i)^n}
$$

The word "Net" means it accounts for the initial outlay. So: **NPV = Net effect = What you get - What you pay**

### Example: Same Problem, Two Languages

**Scenario**: Invest \$1,000 today, receive \$1,200 in 2 years at 10% interest.

**Classical approach** (compute NPV):
$$
NPV = -1000 + \frac{1200}{(1.10)^2} = -1000 + 991.74 = -\$8.26
$$
**Decision**: Reject (NPV < 0)

**Value function approach** (compute $V(0)$):
$$
V(0) = -1000 \cdot (1.10)^{0} + \frac{1200}{(1.10)^2} = -1000 + 991.74 = -\$8.26
$$
**Decision**: Reject ($V(0) < 0$)

**Same answer!** But the value function also tells you the value at other times:
- $V(1) = -1000 \cdot (1.10)^1 + \frac{1200}{(1.10)^1} = -1100 + 1090.91 = -\$9.09$
- $V(2) = -1000 \cdot (1.10)^2 + 1200 = -1210 + 1200 = -\$10.00$

The classical approach only tells you "reject it." The value function tells you "reject it, *and here's how badly you'd be doing at each point in time*."

### Why Each Approach Is Useful

::: {.callout-important icon="true"}
## When to Use Each Approach

**Use Classical Formulas (PV/FV/NPV) when:**

- You only need a single "yes/no" investment decision
- You're working with standard textbook problems
- You're communicating with practitioners who use traditional finance language
- You need quick calculations

**Use Value Function $V(t)$ when:**

- You need to track financial position over time
- You're comparing different interest rate structures
- You want to understand *how* value evolves, not just the final decision
- You're dealing with complex, multi-period scenarios
- You need a unified framework that handles all time periods consistently

**Best of both worlds**: Understand the value function conceptually, but recognize that PV/FV/NPV are just convenient shortcuts for specific time points!

### Intuition: Why Your Professor Uses $V(t)$

::: {.callout-tip icon="true"}
## The Power of Abstraction

Think of it like this:

**Classical approach**: You have separate tools—a hammer (PV), a screwdriver (FV), and pliers (NPV). Each tool works for specific jobs.

**Value function approach**: You have a Swiss Army knife ($V(t)$) that contains all the tools. Want PV? Use the knife at $t=0$. Want FV? Use it at $t=T$. Want to check your position midway? Use it at $t=5$.

Your professor teaches the Swiss Army knife because:

1. **Generality**: One framework explains everything
2. **Flexibility**: Works at *any* time, not just beginning/end
3. **Insight**: Shows *how* value changes over time, not just snapshots
4. **Rigor**: More mathematically elegant and precise

**Practical tip**: On exams, use whichever approach is faster. For decision problems, NPV is quick. For understanding *why* something works, $V(t)$ provides deeper insight.

## Summary

✅ **Value function** $V(t)$ = financial position at any time $t$\
✅ **Combines** past (accumulated) and future (discounted) cashflows\
✅ **NPV** = $V(0)$ = value at the start\
✅ **Decision rule**: Accept if NPV \> 0\
✅ **Tells a story**: Smoothed continuous view of wealth over time\
✅ **Practical use**: Monitor projects, compare investments

## Key Insight

The value function transforms **discrete cashflows** (jumps) into a **continuous financial narrative** (smooth story). It's the "bank account balance" of the investment at every moment.
