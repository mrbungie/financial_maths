## Introduction

Financial mathematics is fundamentally about tracking **money flows over time**. Before diving into complex formulas, we need to establish a clear language for describing when money moves, in which direction, and how much.

## Definition: Cashflow

A **cashflow** is a payment or receipt of money at a specific point in time. It has three essential components:

1.  **Amount** (how much?)
2.  **Time** (when?)
3.  **Direction** (in or out?)
:::

### The Sign Convention

Understanding which direction is positive is crucial:

| Type        | Description                                | Sign             | Color Code                     |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------|--------------------|
| **Inflow**  | Money received (income, loan disbursement) | **+** (positive) | [●]{style="color:green"} Green |
| **Outflow** | Money paid (expense, loan repayment)       | **−** (negative) | [●]{style="color:red"} Red     |

::: {.callout-tip icon="true"}
## Intuition: Investor vs. Borrower Perspective

The same transaction looks opposite from different viewpoints:

-   **Investor perspective**: Loan disbursement = −100 (money out), Repayment = +110 (money in)
-   **Borrower perspective**: Loan received = +100 (money in), Repayment = −110 (money out)

*Always establish whose perspective you're taking!*
:::

## Cashflow Representations

We can represent cashflows in multiple equivalent ways. Let's use a simple example: borrowing \$1,000 today and repaying \$1,100 in one year.

### 1. Cashflow Table (Borrower's View)

| Time (years) | Cashflow (\$) | Type    | Description   |
|--------------|---------------|---------|---------------|
| 0            | +1,000        | Inflow  | Loan received |
| 1            | −1,100        | Outflow | Repayment     |

Let's examine a simple but important financial instrument: a **zero-coupon bond (ZCB)**. These are financial contracts that guarantee the holder, on the part of the issuer, the payment of a specific sum $F$ (face value) at a later date (maturity). To acquire this right, the investor must pay a certain price $P$ at issue.

### Cashflow Table (Investor's Perspective)

| Time | Date | Cashflow (€) | Type | Description |
|------|------|--------------|------|-------------|
| 0 | 01/01/2024 | −960 | Outflow | Price paid ($P$) |
| 1 year | 31/12/2024 | +1,000 | Inflow | Face value received ($F$) |

\FloatBarrier

::: {.callout-note icon="true"}
## Understanding the Transaction

-   **Time 01/01/2024**: Investor pays €960 to purchase the bond (outflow)
-   **Time 31/12/2024** (maturity): Investor receives €1,000 face value (inflow)
-   **Interest**: The difference $I = F - P = 1,000 - 960 = €40$ represents the interest earned

**Key insight**: The face value can be thought of as price (€960) + interest (€40).

## Pattern Recognition

This is an **investment pattern**:

- Initial **outflow** (−€960): You pay money
- Subsequent **inflow** (+€1,000): You receive money back plus interest

From the **issuer's perspective** (borrower), this would be a **financing pattern** with signs reversed:

- They receive €960 (inflow)
- They pay €1,000 at maturity (outflow)

:::

When you make a loan payment, that single cashflow actually represents **two distinct economic components**. Understanding this decomposition is crucial for financial analysis.

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Payment Decomposition

Any loan payment can be split into:

$$
\text{Payment} = \text{Interest} + \text{Principal Repayment}
$$

**Interest**: The "rent" you pay for using borrowed money (compensation to lender)

**Principal**: The portion that reduces your debt balance
:::

### What Does Interest Represent? {#sec-interest-meaning}

Before diving into mechanics, let's understand **why** interest exists. Interest has multiple interpretations, all equivalent:

::: {.callout-important icon="true"}
## Economic Meaning of Interest

1. **Compensation for waiting**: Interest represents a payment to the lender for **postponing** consumption and waiting for reimbursement of the amount due.

2. **Price of time**: Interest is the **reward** received for having agreed to delay the settlement of a debt. Time has value, and interest is its price.

3. **Return on investment**: From the investor's perspective, interest is the **return** earned on the invested capital.

4. **Opportunity cost**: Interest compensates for alternative uses of money—what you give up by lending instead of spending or investing elsewhere.
:::

::: {.callout-warning icon="true"}
## Simplifying Assumption: Risk-Free World

Throughout this course, **we assume an idealized world where interest represents pure compensation for time**, abstracting away:

- **Credit risk**: We assume all parties will honor their obligations with certainty
- **Default risk**: No possibility of non-payment or bankruptcy
- **Market risk**: Interest rates remain stable and predictable

This allows us to focus on the **fundamental time value of money** without the complexities of risk management. In real-world applications, interest rates include additional premiums for these risks—topics covered in advanced finance courses.

**Key takeaway**: The interest we study here is the **risk-free rate**—the minimum return required simply for waiting, not for bearing uncertainty.
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon="true"}
## Intuition: Why Does Interest Exist?

Think about a zero-coupon bond example: Why would you accept €960 today instead of demanding the full €1,000 right now?

**Because time has value!**

- **Inflation**: €960 today might buy more than €960 next year
- **Risk**: There's uncertainty about receiving payment in the future
- **Opportunity cost**: You could invest that €960 elsewhere during the year
- **Preference for liquidity**: People generally prefer having money now rather than later

Interest (say €40) compensates for all these factors. It's the "price" that makes you **indifferent** between:

- Having €960 today, OR
- Having €1,000 in one year

Without interest, nobody would lend money—there'd be no incentive!

**Real-world check**: Would you lend someone €100 today if they promised to pay you back exactly €100 in 5 years? Of course not! You'd want interest to make it worthwhile.
:::

### Interest vs. Interest Rate {#sec-interest-vs-rate}

::: {.callout-tip icon="true"}
## What's the Difference?

**Interest** ($I$): Absolute amount in currency

- "I earned €40"
- Depends on how much you invested
- Measured in euros, dollars, etc.

**Interest rate** ($i$): Relative percentage return

- "I earned 4.167%"
- Independent of investment size (percentage is the same whether you invest €960 or €96,000)
- Dimensionless (it's a ratio)

**Why rates matter**: They allow comparison across different investment sizes!

- Investment A: Pay €960, receive €1,000 → Interest = €40, Rate = 4.167%
- Investment B: Pay €10,000, receive €10,500 → Interest = €500, Rate = 5%

Investment B has higher absolute interest (€500 > €40) but you can't directly compare them. The **rates** (5% vs 4.167%) tell you that Investment B offers a better return **per euro invested**.

Two fundamental patterns emerge in financial mathematics:

### Investment Cashflow Pattern

**Typical structure**: Initial outflow, followed by inflows

### Financing Cashflow Pattern

**Examples**:

- Taking a loan
- Issuing bonds (from issuer's perspective)
- Credit card borrowing

::: {.callout-important icon="true"}
## Key Insight

**Investment** and **financing** are mirror images of each other!

-   An investor's outflow is the borrower's inflow
-   The lender's expected returns = the borrower's cost of capital
:::

## Time Conventions and Periods

### Time Measurement

::: {.callout-note icon="true"}
## Definition: Time Index

We typically denote time by $t$, measured in **years** unless otherwise specified.

-   $t = 0$: Today (present moment)
-   $t = 1$: One year from now
-   $t = 0.5$: Six months from now
-   $t = -1$: One year ago
:::

### Period vs. Point-in-Time

Be careful to distinguish:

-   **Point in time** (e.g., $t=2$): A specific moment
-   **Time period** (e.g., "year 2"): The interval from $t=1$ to $t=2$

**Interest earned in year 2** refers to the interval $[1, 2]$, but the **payment at time 2** refers to the instant $t=2$.

## Comprehensive Example: Four-Period Investment/Borrowing Operation

Let's apply **all the concepts** we've learned to analyze a realistic quarterly loan scenario. This example demonstrates that **there is no unique way** to decompose installments into interest and principal portions—multiple valid decompositions exist.

::: {.callout-caution icon=true}
## References

**Slide:** Financial Mathematics Slides 1-96, Slides 10-12 (Four-period investment/borrowing operation with two decompositions), Page 10, [Direct Link](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mrbungie/financial_maths@main/resources/slideshows/25_09_30_FinancialMathematics_Slides_1_96.pdf#page=10)
:::

**Scenario**: A **four-period borrowing operation** to finance working capital:

-   **Loan amount (principal $S$)**: €1,000
-   **Repayment**: Three equal quarterly installments of €380
-   **Dates**: 12/24 (disbursement), 03/25, 06/25, 09/25 (payments)

**Question**: How can we split each €380 installment into interest and principal portions?

### Step 1: Cashflow Table

**Cashflow Table** (borrower's perspective):

| Time | Date   | Total Cashflow ($R$) | Type    | Description      |
|------|--------|----------------------|---------|------------------|
| 0    | 12/24  | +1,000               | Inflow  | Loan received ($S$) |
| 1    | 03/25  | −380                 | Outflow | 1st installment ($R_1$) |
| 2    | 06/25  | −380                 | Outflow | 2nd installment ($R_2$) |
| 3    | 09/25  | −380                 | Outflow | 3rd installment ($R_3$) |

\FloatBarrier

### Step 2: Decomposition into Interest and Principal

Conventionally, each installment $R$ is split between an **interest portion** $I$ and a **principal portion** $C$:

$$
R_k = C_k + I_k
$$

Where:

- $D_k$ = Outstanding debt (remaining balance) at time $k$
- $R_k$ = Total payment (installment) at time $k$
- $C_k$ = Principal portion (capital reduction) at time $k$
- $I_k$ = Interest portion at time $k$ (remunerates the time value of money)

It's natural to think about the **remaining balance** or **outstanding debt** $D$ after an installment has been paid:

$$
\begin{aligned}
D_{31/12} &= S = \text{€1,000} \\
D_{31/03} &= S - C_{31/03} \\
D_{30/06} &= D_{31/03} - C_{30/06} = S - C_{31/03} - C_{30/06} \\
D_{30/09} &= D_{30/06} - C_{30/09} = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

### Step 3: Complete Decomposition Table

| Time | Date  | Payment $R$ | Interest $I$ | Principal $C$ | Outstanding Debt $D$ |
|------|-------|-------------|--------------|---------------|----------------------|
| 0    | 12/24 | €1,000      | —            | —             | €1,000               |
| 1    | 03/25 | −€380       | −€46.67      | −€333.33      | €666.67              |
| 2    | 06/25 | −€380       | −€46.67      | −€333.33      | €333.34              |
| 3    | 09/25 | −€380       | −€46.66      | −€333.34      | €0                   |

**Note**: $C$ is intended as a partial repayment of the debt, while $I$ remunerates the time value of money.

::: {.callout-warning icon=true}
## Important Remark

Since we have not yet established a rule (financial law) for decomposing the installment into principal and interest portions, **other decompositions are equally valid in principle**. The specific split shown here is just one possibility. Later, when we study financial laws, we'll learn how to determine the appropriate decomposition for any given situation.

### Step 6: Pattern Identification

This is a **financing pattern** from the borrower's perspective:

- Initial **inflow** (+€1,000): You receive money
- Subsequent **outflows** (−€380 each quarter): You pay back

The **opposite perspective** (lender's view) would show an **investment pattern**:

- Initial **outflow** (−€1,000): Lender pays money
- Subsequent **inflows** (+€380 each quarter): Lender receives payments

### Step 7: Key Insights

::: {.callout-important icon="true"}
## Complete Analysis

**Decomposition shows**: Each €380 payment contains approximately €47 interest and €333 principal repayment

**Pattern**: This is financing (borrow now, pay later in installments)

**Total payments**: €380 × 3 = **€1,140**

**Total interest**: €1,140 − €1,000 = **€140** over 3 quarters

**Perspective matters**: From the lender's view, this €140 is their return on investment!

So far we've described cashflows informally using tables and timelines. Now we introduce a **formal mathematical notation** used by the professor to precisely describe financial transactions.

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Financial Transaction Notation

A **financial transaction** is completely described by its **cash flow stream** associated with its **schedule**. We write this as:

$$
\mathbf{x}/\mathbf{t}
$$

Where:

- $\mathbf{x} = \{x_0, x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$ = cash flows (amounts)
- $\mathbf{t} = \{t_0, t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n\}$ = schedule (time points)
- $x_i$ is the cashflow at time $t_i$
:::

### Basic Example

Let's revisit our loan example using this notation:

**Informal description**: Borrow $1,000 today, repay $1,100 in 1 year

**Formal notation** (borrower's perspective):

$$
\mathbf{x}/\mathbf{t} = \{1000, -1100\} / \{0, 1\}
$$

This means:

- At time $t_0 = 0$: cashflow $x_0 = +1000$ (receive loan)
- At time $t_1 = 1$: cashflow $x_1 = -1100$ (repay loan)

### Equivalence of Transactions

::: {.callout-important icon=true}
## Key Concept: Transaction Equivalence

Two financial transactions are **equivalent** if they have the **same nonzero cash flows on the same schedule**.
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: Why Equivalence Matters

Mathematically, adding zeros doesn't change the financial reality — just like writing "$5.00" vs "$5" means the same amount. However, **relevance matters**: reporting cashflows at arbitrary periods only makes sense when it aligns with the operation's natural schedule and lifecycle.

**When zeros are useful:**

- **Comparing transactions** with different schedules (align them to match periods)
- **Combining operations** that naturally occur at different times
- **Standardizing reporting** when operations genuinely span those periods

**When zeros aren't useful:**

- Reporting **finer granularity** than the operation's actual schedule (e.g., monthly reports for a quarterly loan)
- Extending reports **beyond the operation's lifecycle** (e.g., reporting periods after the loan ends)

Think of it this way: You *can* write "$0" for June 15th if nothing happens then, but it only makes sense to do so if you're actually tracking that date for a reason relevant to the operation itself!
:::

**Example**: These two representations are equivalent:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{x}/\mathbf{t} &= \{-10, 8, 8\} / \{0, 1, 2\} \\
\mathbf{x}'/\mathbf{t}' &= \{-10, 0, 8, 8, 0\} / \{0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3\}
\end{aligned}
$$

The second transaction extends the schedule to include times 0.5 and 3 with zero cashflows, but it describes the same financial operation.



### Sum of Financial Transactions

We can combine two transactions using the **sum operator** $\oplus$:

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Sum of Transactions

Given two transactions $\mathbf{x}/\mathbf{t}$ and $\mathbf{x}'/\mathbf{t}'$:

1. Extend both to a common schedule $\mathbf{t}'' = \mathbf{t} \cup \mathbf{t}'$
2. Sum the cashflows at each time point
3. Notation: $\mathbf{x}''/\mathbf{t}'' = \mathbf{x}/\mathbf{t} \oplus \mathbf{x}'/\mathbf{t}'$
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: Adding Cashflow Streams

The sum operator $\oplus$ is like **merging two bank accounts** into one. Imagine:

- **Account A**: You have three transactions scheduled
- **Account B**: You have three different transactions scheduled
- **Combined view**: What's your total position at each point in time?

**Real-world example**: You have two part-time jobs. Job A pays $800 on the 1st and 15th. Job B pays $500 on the 10th and 20th. Your total income stream is the sum of both schedules — you need to know when ALL money arrives to plan your budget!

This is fundamental for:

- **Portfolio management**: Combining multiple investments
- **Business planning**: Aggregating different revenue/expense streams
- **Debt management**: Tracking multiple loans simultaneously
:::

**Example**: Combining two loan payments

| Transaction A | $\mathbf{x}/\mathbf{t} = \{-10, 8, 8\} / \{0, 1, 2\}$ |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Transaction B | $\mathbf{x}'/\mathbf{t}' = \{-3, 2, 2\} / \{0, 2, 4\}$ |

**Step 1**: Find common schedule $\mathbf{t}'' = \{0, 1, 2, 4\}$

**Step 2**: Extend both transactions:

- Transaction A: $\{-10, 8, 8, 0\} / \{0, 1, 2, 4\}$
- Transaction B: $\{-3, 0, 2, 2\} / \{0, 1, 2, 4\}$

**Step 3**: Sum cashflows at each time:

$$
\mathbf{x}''/\mathbf{t}'' = \{-10-3, 8+0, 8+2, 0+2\} / \{0, 1, 2, 4\} = \{-13, 8, 10, 2\} / \{0, 1, 2, 4\}
$$

**Table representation**:

| Time | Transaction A | Transaction B | Sum (A ⊕ B) |
|:----:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----------:|
| 0 | −10 | −3 | **−13** |
| 1 | +8 | 0 | **+8** |
| 2 | +8 | +2 | **+10** |
| 4 | 0 | +2 | **+2** |

### Decomposing Financial Transactions

We can also **decompose** a transaction into smaller parts:

#### 1. Decomposition by Date

Split a transaction at a reference date $t^*$, separating what happens before from what happens after.

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: Time-Based Split

Splitting by date is like **cutting your financial timeline with scissors**. Useful for:

- **Quarterly/annual reporting**: "What happened in Q1 vs Q2?"
- **Evaluation checkpoints**: "Did I break even by year-end?"
- **Project phases**: "Costs before launch vs maintenance after"
- **Sale/transfer**: "You keep cashflows before the sale date, I get the rest"

**Example**: You sell a rental property mid-year. You get the rent payments before the sale date; the buyer gets payments after. This split helps determine the fair sale price!
:::

**Example**: Split transaction $\mathbf{x}''/\mathbf{t}'' = \{10, -4, -4, -4\} / \{0, 1, 2, 3\}$ at $t^* = 1.5$

**Before $t^*$** (times $\leq 1.5$):
$$
\mathbf{x}_{\text{before}}/\mathbf{t}_{\text{before}} = \{10, -4\} / \{0, 1\}
$$

**After $t^*$** (times $> 1.5$):
$$
\mathbf{x}_{\text{after}}/\mathbf{t}_{\text{after}} = \{-4, -4\} / \{2, 3\}
$$

**Verification**: $\mathbf{x}_{\text{before}}/\mathbf{t}_{\text{before}} \oplus \mathbf{x}_{\text{after}}/\mathbf{t}_{\text{after}} = \mathbf{x}''/\mathbf{t}''$ ✓

**Table representation**:

| Time | Original | Before $t^* = 1.5$ | After $t^* = 1.5$ |
|:----:|:--------:|:------------------:|:-----------------:|
| 0 | +10 | +10 | — |
| 1 | −4 | −4 | — |
| 2 | −4 | — | −4 |
| 3 | −4 | — | −4 |

#### 2. Decomposition by Algebraic Sign

Separate positive cashflows (inflows) from negative cashflows (outflows).

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: Separating Money In vs Money Out

Decomposing by sign is like **having two separate jars**: one for income, one for expenses. Useful for:

- **Cash management**: "How much am I expecting to receive vs pay?"
- **Budgeting**: Separate income sources from expenses
- **Accounting**: Assets (inflows) vs Liabilities (outflows)
- **Liquidity planning**: "Do I have enough inflows to cover outflows?"

**Example**: A small business owner splits revenues (inflows) from costs (outflows) to quickly see: "Am I making more than I'm spending?" Each jar tells a different story, but together they show the complete picture!
:::

**Example**: Same transaction $\{10, -4, -4, -4\} / \{0, 1, 2, 3\}$

**Inflows** (positive):
$$
\mathbf{a}/\mathbf{t} = \{10\} / \{0\}
$$

**Outflows** (negative):
$$
\mathbf{l}/\mathbf{t}' = \{-4, -4, -4\} / \{1, 2, 3\}
$$

**Verification**: $\mathbf{a}/\mathbf{t} \oplus \mathbf{l}/\mathbf{t}' = \{10, -4, -4, -4\} / \{0, 1, 2, 3\}$ ✓

**Table summary**:

| Time | Original | Inflows (a) | Outflows (l) |
|:----:|:--------:|:-----------:|:------------:|
| 0 | +10 | +10 | 0 |
| 1 | −4 | 0 | −4 |

## Why This Notation Matters

This formal notation $\mathbf{x}/\mathbf{t}$ allows us to:

1. **Precisely specify** financial operations without ambiguity
2. **Combine transactions** algebraically using the $\oplus$ operator
3. **Decompose complex transactions** into simpler components
4. **Compare transactions** for equivalence
5. **Build up** to the value function and NPV calculations (next chapter!)

Think of it as the "algebra of money flows" — just as we can add numbers, we can now add entire cashflow streams!
:::


## Summary

Before moving forward, make sure you understand:

✅ **Cashflows** have amount, timing, and direction\
✅ **Sign convention**: Positive = inflow, Negative = outflow\
✅ **Perspective matters**: Same transaction looks different to different parties\
✅ **Three representations**: Tables, timelines, and diagrams all show the same information\
✅ **Two patterns**: Investment (− then +) vs. Financing (+ then −)\
✅ **Formal notation**: $\mathbf{x}/\mathbf{t}$ precisely describes cashflows and schedules\
✅ **Operations**: Transactions can be summed ($\oplus$) and decomposed


::: {.callout-warning icon="true"}
## Common Pitfall

Don't mix perspectives! If you start from the borrower's viewpoint, stay consistent. Switching midway through a problem causes sign errors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Next**: In [Chapter 2: Bonds](bonds.qmd), we'll apply these cashflow concepts to understand bond pricing and accrued interest.
