# Basic Notions

## Introduction

Financial mathematics is fundamentally about tracking **money flows over time**. Before diving into complex formulas, we need to establish a clear language for describing when money moves, in which direction, and how much.

## Definition: Cashflow

A **cashflow** is a payment or receipt of money at a specific point in time. It has three essential components:

1.  **Amount** (how much?)
2.  **Time** (when?)
3.  **Direction** (in or out?)
:::

### The Sign Convention

Understanding which direction is positive is crucial:

| Type        | Description                                | Sign             | Color Code                     |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------|--------------------|
| **Inflow**  | Money received (income, loan disbursement) | **+** (positive) | [●]{style="color:green"} Green |
| **Outflow** | Money paid (expense, loan repayment)       | **−** (negative) | [●]{style="color:red"} Red     |

::: {.callout-tip icon="true"}
## Intuition: Investor vs. Borrower Perspective

The same transaction looks opposite from different viewpoints:

-   **Investor perspective**: Loan disbursement = −100 (money out), Repayment = +110 (money in)
-   **Borrower perspective**: Loan received = +100 (money in), Repayment = −110 (money out)

*Always establish whose perspective you're taking!*
:::

## Cashflow Representations

We can represent cashflows in multiple equivalent ways. Let's use a simple example: borrowing \$1,000 today and repaying \$1,100 in one year.

### 1. Cashflow Table (Borrower's View)

| Time (years) | Cashflow (\$) | Type    | Description   |
|--------------|---------------|---------|---------------|
| 0            | +1,000        | Inflow  | Loan received |
| 1            | −1,100        | Outflow | Repayment     |

## Multiple Cashflows: Loan Amortization Example

Let's see a more realistic scenario: a 3-year loan of \$10,000 with annual payments.

### Cashflow Table

| Time (years) | Payment | Outstanding Balance |
|--------------|---------|---------------------|
| 0            | +10,000 | 10,000              |
| 1            | −3,500  | 7,000               |
| 2            | −3,650  | 3,700               |
| 3            | −3,885  | 0                   |

\FloatBarrier

::: {.callout-note icon="true"}
## Understanding the Table

-   **Time 0**: Borrower receives the loan (+\$10,000 inflow)
-   **Each year**: Borrower makes a payment (outflow)
-   **Outstanding Balance**: What remains to be paid

**Notice**: Each payment can be split into **Interest** and **Principal** components. We'll explore this decomposition in detail in the next section!

When you make a loan payment, that single cashflow actually represents **two distinct economic components**. Understanding this decomposition is crucial for financial analysis.

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Payment Decomposition

Any loan payment can be split into:

$$
\text{Payment} = \text{Interest} + \text{Principal Repayment}
$$

**Interest**: The "rent" you pay for using borrowed money (compensation to lender)

**Principal**: The portion that reduces your debt balance
:::

### The Mechanics of Decomposition

Let's see how this works period by period using our loan example:

**Given**: $10,000 loan at 5% annual interest

#### Year 1 Decomposition

Starting balance: $10,000

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Interest} &= \text{Balance} \times \text{Rate} = \$10,000 \times 0.05 = \$500 \\
\text{Payment} &= \$3,500 \\
\text{Principal} &= \text{Payment} - \text{Interest} = \$3,500 - \$500 = \$3,000 \\
\text{New Balance} &= \$10,000 - \$3,000 = \$7,000
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Year 2 Decomposition

Starting balance: $7,000

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Interest} &= \$7,000 \times 0.05 = \$350 \\
\text{Payment} &= \$3,650 \\
\text{Principal} &= \$3,650 - \$350 = \$3,300 \\
\text{New Balance} &= \$7,000 - \$3,300 = \$3,700
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Year 3 Decomposition

Starting balance: $3,700

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Interest} &= \$3,700 \times 0.05 = \$185 \\
\text{Payment} &= \$3,885 \\
\text{Principal} &= \$3,885 - \$185 = \$3,700 \\
\text{New Balance} &= \$3,700 - \$3,700 = \$0
\end{aligned}
$$

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Key Observations

1. **Interest decreases** over time (because balance decreases)
2. **Principal increases** over time (more of each payment goes to debt reduction)
3. **Total payment changes** each period to maintain the amortization schedule
4. The **proportions shift**: Early payments are mostly interest, later payments are mostly principal

Two fundamental patterns emerge in financial mathematics:

### Investment Cashflow Pattern

**Typical structure**: Initial outflow, followed by inflows

```{=latex}
\begin{figure}[h]

% Time axis
\draw[thick,->] (0,0) -- (13,0) node[right] {Time};
\foreach \x/\label in {0/0, 4/1, 8/2, 12/3}

**Examples**:

- Buying stocks or bonds
- Starting a business
- Purchasing rental property

### Financing Cashflow Pattern

**Typical structure**: Initial inflow, followed by outflows

```{=latex}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.0]
% Time axis
\draw[thick,->] (0,0) -- (13,0) node[right] {Time};

% Label
\node[font=\bfseries] at (6,1.5) {Financing Pattern};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
```

**Examples**:

- Taking a loan
- Issuing bonds (from issuer's perspective)
- Credit card borrowing

::: {.callout-important icon="true"}
## Key Insight

**Investment** and **financing** are mirror images of each other!

-   An investor's outflow is the borrower's inflow
-   The lender's expected returns = the borrower's cost of capital
:::

## Time Conventions and Periods

### Time Measurement

::: {.callout-note icon="true"}
## Definition: Time Index

We typically denote time by $t$, measured in **years** unless otherwise specified.

-   $t = 0$: Today (present moment)
-   $t = 1$: One year from now
-   $t = 0.5$: Six months from now
-   $t = -1$: One year ago
:::

### Period vs. Point-in-Time

Be careful to distinguish:

-   **Point in time** (e.g., $t=2$): A specific moment
-   **Time period** (e.g., "year 2"): The interval from $t=1$ to $t=2$

**Interest earned in year 2** refers to the interval $[1, 2]$, but the **payment at time 2** refers to the instant $t=2$.

## Comprehensive Example: Quarterly Loan Operation

Let's apply **all the concepts** we've learned to analyze a realistic quarterly loan scenario (based on slides 5-9).

::: {.callout-caution icon=true}
## References

**Slide:** Financial Mathematics Slides 1-96, Slides 5-9 (Four-period investment/borrowing operation with decomposition), Page 5, [Direct Link](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mrbungie/financial_maths@main/resources/slideshows/25_09_30_FinancialMathematics_Slides_1_96.pdf#page=5)
:::

**Scenario**: You're taking a **quarterly loan** to finance working capital:

-   **Loan amount (principal S)**: €1,000
-   **Repayment**: Equal quarterly installments of €380
-   **Dates**: 31/12/2024, 31/03/2025, 30/06/2025, 31/09/2025

**Question**: In each installment, how much of the payment is interest?

### Step 1: Cashflow Table (Borrower's Perspective)

| Time       | Total Cashflow ($R$) | Type    | Description      |
|------------|----------------------|---------|------------------|
| 31/12/2024 | +1,000               | Inflow  | Loan received    |
| 31/03/2025 | −380                 | Outflow | 1st installment  |
| 30/06/2025 | −380                 | Outflow | 2nd installment  |
| 31/09/2025 | −380                 | Outflow | 3rd installment  |

\FloatBarrier

### Step 2: Decomposition Table

Each payment $R$ splits into **interest portion** $I$ and **principal portion** $C$:

$$
R_k = I_k + C_k
$$

Where:
- $D_k$ = Outstanding debt at beginning of period $k$
- $R_k$ = Payment (installment) at end of period $k$
- $I_k$ = Interest portion
- $C_k$ = Principal portion (capital reduction)

#### Complete Decomposition Table

| Time       | Debt $D_k$ | Payment $R_k$ | Interest $I_k$ | Principal $C_k$ | New Balance |
|------------|------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 31/12/2024 | 1,000      | —             | —              | —               | 1,000       |
| 31/03/2025 | 1,000      | 380           | 46.67          | 333.33          | 666.67      |
| 30/06/2025 | 666.67     | 380           | 46.67          | 333.33          | 333.33      |
| 31/09/2025 | 333.33     | 380           | 46.67          | 333.33          | 0           |

**Calculation details** (assuming constant period rate):

For each quarter:
$$
\begin{aligned}
I_k &\approx \text{€46.67} \text{ (interest)} \\
C_k &= 380 - 46.67 = \text{€333.33} \text{ (principal reduction)} \\
D_{k+1} &= D_k - C_k
\end{aligned}
$$

### Step 5: Pattern Identification

This is a **financing pattern**:

- Initial **inflow** (+€1,000): You receive money
- Subsequent **outflows** (−€380 each quarter): You pay back

The **opposite perspective** (lender's view) would show an **investment pattern**:

- Initial outflow (loan disbursement)
- Subsequent inflows (receiving payments)

### Step 6: Cumulative Net Position

| Time       | Cashflow | Cumulative Net | Status           |
|------------|----------|----------------|------------------|
| 31/12/2024 | +1,000   | +1,000         | ✓ Have money     |
| 31/03/2025 | −380     | +620           | ✓ Still positive |
| 30/06/2025 | −380     | +240           | ✓ Still positive |
| 31/09/2025 | −380     | −140           | ✗ Net negative   |

## Complete Analysis

**Decomposition shows**: Each €380 payment contains approximately €47 interest and €333 principal

**Pattern**: This is financing (borrow now, pay later in installments)

**Cumulative view**: You pay back **€1,140** total for a **€1,000** loan

**True cost**: €1,140 − €1,000 = **€140** in total interest over 3 quarters

**Period rate**: The interest rate per quarter is $i_k = I_k / D_k \approx 46.67 / 1000 = 4.67\%$

**Perspective matters**: From the lender's view, this €140 is their profit!

## Summary

Before moving forward, make sure you understand:

✅ **Cashflows** have amount, timing, and direction\
✅ **Sign convention**: Positive = inflow, Negative = outflow\
✅ **Perspective matters**: Same transaction looks different to different parties\
✅ **Three representations**: Tables, timelines, and diagrams all show the same information\
✅ **Two patterns**: Investment (− then +) vs. Financing (+ then −)

## Common Pitfall

Don't mix perspectives! If you start from the borrower's viewpoint, stay consistent. Switching midway through a problem causes sign errors.
