## Introduction

Financial mathematics is fundamentally about tracking **money flows over time**. Before diving into complex formulas, we need to establish a clear language for describing when money moves, in which direction, and how much.

## Definition: Cashflow

A **cashflow** is a payment or receipt of money at a specific point in time. It has three essential components:

1.  **Amount** (how much?)
2.  **Time** (when?)
3.  **Direction** (in or out?)
:::

### The Sign Convention

Understanding which direction is positive is crucial:

| Type        | Description                                | Sign             | Color Code                     |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------|--------------------|
| **Inflow**  | Money received (income, loan disbursement) | **+** (positive) | [●]{style="color:green"} Green |
| **Outflow** | Money paid (expense, loan repayment)       | **−** (negative) | [●]{style="color:red"} Red     |

::: {.callout-tip icon="true"}
## Intuition: Investor vs. Borrower Perspective

The same transaction looks opposite from different viewpoints:

-   **Investor perspective**: Loan disbursement = −100 (money out), Repayment = +110 (money in)
-   **Borrower perspective**: Loan received = +100 (money in), Repayment = −110 (money out)

*Always establish whose perspective you're taking!*
:::

## Cashflow Representations

We can represent cashflows in multiple equivalent ways. Let's use a simple example: borrowing \$1,000 today and repaying \$1,100 in one year.

### 1. Cashflow Table (Borrower's View)

| Time (years) | Cashflow (\$) | Type    | Description   |
|--------------|---------------|---------|---------------|
| 0            | +1,000        | Inflow  | Loan received |
| 1            | −1,100        | Outflow | Repayment     |

## Multiple Cashflows: Loan Amortization Example

Let's see a more realistic scenario: a 3-year loan of \$10,000 with annual payments.

### Cashflow Table

| Time (years) | Payment | Outstanding Balance |
|--------------|---------|---------------------|
| 0            | +10,000 | 10,000              |
| 1            | −3,500  | 7,000               |
| 2            | −3,650  | 3,700               |
| 3            | −3,885  | 0                   |

\FloatBarrier

::: {.callout-note icon="true"}
## Understanding the Table

-   **Time 0**: Borrower receives the loan (+\$10,000 inflow)
-   **Each year**: Borrower makes a payment (outflow)
-   **Outstanding Balance**: What remains to be paid

**Notice**: Each payment can be split into **Interest** and **Principal** components. We'll explore this decomposition in detail in the next section!

When you make a loan payment, that single cashflow actually represents **two distinct economic components**. Understanding this decomposition is crucial for financial analysis.

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Payment Decomposition

Any loan payment can be split into:

$$
\text{Payment} = \text{Interest} + \text{Principal Repayment}
$$

**Interest**: The "rent" you pay for using borrowed money (compensation to lender)

**Principal**: The portion that reduces your debt balance
:::

### The Mechanics of Decomposition

Let's see how this works period by period using our loan example:

**Given**: $10,000 loan at 5% annual interest

#### Year 1 Decomposition

Starting balance: $10,000

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Interest} &= \text{Balance} \times \text{Rate} = \$10,000 \times 0.05 = \$500 \\
\text{Payment} &= \$3,500 \\
\text{Principal} &= \text{Payment} - \text{Interest} = \$3,500 - \$500 = \$3,000 \\
\text{New Balance} &= \$10,000 - \$3,000 = \$7,000
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Year 2 Decomposition

Starting balance: $7,000

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Interest} &= \$7,000 \times 0.05 = \$350 \\
\text{Payment} &= \$3,650 \\
\text{Principal} &= \$3,650 - \$350 = \$3,300 \\
\text{New Balance} &= \$7,000 - \$3,300 = \$3,700
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Year 3 Decomposition

Starting balance: $3,700

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Interest} &= \$3,700 \times 0.05 = \$185 \\
\text{Payment} &= \$3,885 \\
\text{Principal} &= \$3,885 - \$185 = \$3,700 \\
\text{New Balance} &= \$3,700 - \$3,700 = \$0
\end{aligned}
$$

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Key Observations

1. **Interest decreases** over time (because balance decreases)
2. **Principal increases** over time (more of each payment goes to debt reduction)
3. **Total payment changes** each period to maintain the amortization schedule
4. The **proportions shift**: Early payments are mostly interest, later payments are mostly principal

Two fundamental patterns emerge in financial mathematics:

### Investment Cashflow Pattern

**Typical structure**: Initial outflow, followed by inflows

```{=latex}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.0]
% Time axis
\draw[thick,->] (0,0) -- (13,0) node[right] {Time};
\foreach \x/\label in {0/0, 4/1, 8/2, 12/3}

    \draw[->,green!60!black,very thick] (\x,-1) -- (\x,0.5);
    \node[above,green!60!black,font=\small] at (\x,0.7) {+\$500};
}

% Final inflow at t=3

% Label
\node[font=\bfseries] at (6,1.5) {Investment Pattern};

\end{figure}
```

**Examples**:

- Buying stocks or bonds
- Starting a business
- Purchasing rental property

### Financing Cashflow Pattern

**Typical structure**: Initial inflow, followed by outflows

```{=latex}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.0]
% Time axis
\draw[thick,->] (0,0) -- (13,0) node[right] {Time};

    \draw (\x,0.1) -- (\x,-0.1) node[below] {\label};

\node[above,red!70!black,font=\small] at (4,0.7) {−\$3,500};

% Label
\node[font=\bfseries] at (6,1.5) {Financing Pattern};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
```

**Examples**:

- Taking a loan
- Issuing bonds (from issuer's perspective)
- Credit card borrowing

::: {.callout-important icon="true"}
## Key Insight

**Investment** and **financing** are mirror images of each other!

-   An investor's outflow is the borrower's inflow
-   The lender's expected returns = the borrower's cost of capital
:::

## Time Conventions and Periods

### Time Measurement

::: {.callout-note icon="true"}
## Definition: Time Index

We typically denote time by $t$, measured in **years** unless otherwise specified.

-   $t = 0$: Today (present moment)
-   $t = 1$: One year from now
-   $t = 0.5$: Six months from now
-   $t = -1$: One year ago
:::

### Period vs. Point-in-Time

Be careful to distinguish:

-   **Point in time** (e.g., $t=2$): A specific moment
-   **Time period** (e.g., "year 2"): The interval from $t=1$ to $t=2$

**Interest earned in year 2** refers to the interval $[1, 2]$, but the **payment at time 2** refers to the instant $t=2$.

## Comprehensive Example: Quarterly Loan Operation

Let's apply **all the concepts** we've learned to analyze a realistic quarterly loan scenario (based on slides 5-9).

::: {.callout-caution icon=true}
## References

**Slide:** Financial Mathematics Slides 1-96, Slides 5-9 (Four-period investment/borrowing operation with decomposition), Page 5, [Direct Link](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mrbungie/financial_maths@main/resources/slideshows/25_09_30_FinancialMathematics_Slides_1_96.pdf#page=5)
:::

**Scenario**: You're taking a **quarterly loan** to finance working capital:

-   **Loan amount (principal S)**: €1,000
-   **Repayment**: Equal quarterly installments of €380
-   **Dates**: 31/12/2024, 31/03/2025, 30/06/2025, 31/09/2025

**Question**: In each installment, how much of the payment is interest?

### Step 1: Cashflow Table (Borrower's Perspective)

| Time       | Total Cashflow ($R$) | Type    | Description      |
|------------|----------------------|---------|------------------|
| 31/12/2024 | +1,000               | Inflow  | Loan received    |
| 31/03/2025 | −380                 | Outflow | 1st installment  |
| 30/06/2025 | −380                 | Outflow | 2nd installment  |
| 31/09/2025 | −380                 | Outflow | 3rd installment  |

\FloatBarrier

### Step 2: Decomposition Table

Each payment $R$ splits into **interest portion** $I$ and **principal portion** $C$:

$$
R_k = I_k + C_k
$$

Where:

- $D_k$ = Outstanding debt at beginning of period $k$
- $R_k$ = Payment (installment) at end of period $k$
- $I_k$ = Interest portion
- $C_k$ = Principal portion (capital reduction)

#### Complete Decomposition Table

| Time       | Debt $D_k$ | Payment $R_k$ | Interest $I_k$ | Principal $C_k$ | New Balance |
|------------|------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 31/12/2024 | 1,000      | —             | —              | —               | 1,000       |
| 31/03/2025 | 1,000      | 380           | 46.67          | 333.33          | 666.67      |
| 30/06/2025 | 666.67     | 380           | 46.67          | 333.33          | 333.33      |
| 31/09/2025 | 333.33     | 380           | 46.67          | 333.33          | 0           |

**Calculation details** (assuming constant period rate):

For each quarter:
$$
\begin{aligned}
I_k &\approx \text{€46.67} \text{ (interest)} \\
C_k &= 380 - 46.67 = \text{€333.33} \text{ (principal reduction)} \\
D_{k+1} &= D_k - C_k
\end{aligned}
$$

### Step 5: Pattern Identification

This is a **financing pattern**:

- Initial **inflow** (+€1,000): You receive money
- Subsequent **outflows** (−€380 each quarter): You pay back

The **opposite perspective** (lender's view) would show an **investment pattern**:

- Initial outflow (loan disbursement)
- Subsequent inflows (receiving payments)

### Step 6: Cumulative Net Position

| Time       | Cashflow | Cumulative Net | Status           |
|------------|----------|----------------|------------------|
| 31/12/2024 | +1,000   | +1,000         | ✓ Have money     |
| 31/03/2025 | −380     | +620           | ✓ Still positive |
| 30/06/2025 | −380     | +240           | ✓ Still positive |
| 31/09/2025 | −380     | −140           | ✗ Net negative   |

## Complete Analysis

**Decomposition shows**: Each €380 payment contains approximately €47 interest and €333 principal

**Pattern**: This is financing (borrow now, pay later in installments)

**Cumulative view**: You pay back **€1,140** total for a **€1,000** loan

**True cost**: €1,140 − €1,000 = **€140** in total interest over 3 quarters

**Period rate**: The interest rate per quarter is $i_k = I_k / D_k \approx 46.67 / 1000 = 4.67\%$

**Perspective matters**: From the lender's view, this €140 is their profit!

So far we've described cashflows informally using tables and timelines. Now we introduce a **formal mathematical notation** used by the professor to precisely describe financial transactions.

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Financial Transaction Notation

A **financial transaction** is completely described by its **cash flow stream** associated with its **schedule**. We write this as:

$$
\mathbf{x}/\mathbf{t}
$$

Where:

- $\mathbf{x} = \{x_0, x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$ = cash flows (amounts)
- $\mathbf{t} = \{t_0, t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n\}$ = schedule (time points)
- $x_i$ is the cashflow at time $t_i$
:::

### Basic Example

Let's revisit our loan example using this notation:

**Informal description**: Borrow $1,000 today, repay $1,100 in 1 year

**Formal notation** (borrower's perspective):

$$
\mathbf{x}/\mathbf{t} = \{1000, -1100\} / \{0, 1\}
$$

This means:

- At time $t_0 = 0$: cashflow $x_0 = +1000$ (receive loan)
- At time $t_1 = 1$: cashflow $x_1 = -1100$ (repay loan)

### Equivalence of Transactions

::: {.callout-important icon=true}
## Key Concept: Transaction Equivalence

Two financial transactions are **equivalent** if they have the **same nonzero cash flows on the same schedule**.
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: Why Equivalence Matters

Mathematically, adding zeros doesn't change the financial reality — just like writing "$5.00" vs "$5" means the same amount. However, **relevance matters**: reporting cashflows at arbitrary periods only makes sense when it aligns with the operation's natural schedule and lifecycle.

**When zeros are useful:**

- **Comparing transactions** with different schedules (align them to match periods)
- **Combining operations** that naturally occur at different times
- **Standardizing reporting** when operations genuinely span those periods

**When zeros aren't useful:**

- Reporting **finer granularity** than the operation's actual schedule (e.g., monthly reports for a quarterly loan)
- Extending reports **beyond the operation's lifecycle** (e.g., reporting periods after the loan ends)

Think of it this way: You *can* write "$0" for June 15th if nothing happens then, but it only makes sense to do so if you're actually tracking that date for a reason relevant to the operation itself!
:::

**Example**: These two representations are equivalent:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{x}/\mathbf{t} &= \{-10, 8, 8\} / \{0, 1, 2\} \\
\mathbf{x}'/\mathbf{t}' &= \{-10, 0, 8, 8, 0\} / \{0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3\}
\end{aligned}
$$

The second transaction extends the schedule to include times 0.5 and 3 with zero cashflows, but it describes the same financial operation.



### Sum of Financial Transactions

We can combine two transactions using the **sum operator** $\oplus$:

::: {.callout-note icon=true}
## Definition: Sum of Transactions

Given two transactions $\mathbf{x}/\mathbf{t}$ and $\mathbf{x}'/\mathbf{t}'$:

1. Extend both to a common schedule $\mathbf{t}'' = \mathbf{t} \cup \mathbf{t}'$
2. Sum the cashflows at each time point
3. Notation: $\mathbf{x}''/\mathbf{t}'' = \mathbf{x}/\mathbf{t} \oplus \mathbf{x}'/\mathbf{t}'$
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: Adding Cashflow Streams

The sum operator $\oplus$ is like **merging two bank accounts** into one. Imagine:

- **Account A**: You have three transactions scheduled
- **Account B**: You have three different transactions scheduled
- **Combined view**: What's your total position at each point in time?

**Real-world example**: You have two part-time jobs. Job A pays $800 on the 1st and 15th. Job B pays $500 on the 10th and 20th. Your total income stream is the sum of both schedules — you need to know when ALL money arrives to plan your budget!

This is fundamental for:

- **Portfolio management**: Combining multiple investments
- **Business planning**: Aggregating different revenue/expense streams
- **Debt management**: Tracking multiple loans simultaneously
:::

**Example**: Combining two loan payments

| Transaction A | $\mathbf{x}/\mathbf{t} = \{-10, 8, 8\} / \{0, 1, 2\}$ |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Transaction B | $\mathbf{x}'/\mathbf{t}' = \{-3, 2, 2\} / \{0, 2, 4\}$ |

**Step 1**: Find common schedule $\mathbf{t}'' = \{0, 1, 2, 4\}$

**Step 2**: Extend both transactions:
- Transaction A: $\{-10, 8, 8, 0\} / \{0, 1, 2, 4\}$
- Transaction B: $\{-3, 0, 2, 2\} / \{0, 1, 2, 4\}$

**Step 3**: Sum cashflows at each time:

$$
\mathbf{x}''/\mathbf{t}'' = \{-10-3, 8+0, 8+2, 0+2\} / \{0, 1, 2, 4\} = \{-13, 8, 10, 2\} / \{0, 1, 2, 4\}
$$

**Table representation**:

| Time | Transaction A | Transaction B | Sum (A ⊕ B) |
|:----:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----------:|
| 0 | −10 | −3 | **−13** |
| 1 | +8 | 0 | **+8** |
| 2 | +8 | +2 | **+10** |
| 4 | 0 | +2 | **+2** |

### Decomposing Financial Transactions

We can also **decompose** a transaction into smaller parts:

#### 1. Decomposition by Date

Split a transaction at a reference date $t^*$, separating what happens before from what happens after.

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: Time-Based Split

Splitting by date is like **cutting your financial timeline with scissors**. Useful for:

- **Quarterly/annual reporting**: "What happened in Q1 vs Q2?"
- **Evaluation checkpoints**: "Did I break even by year-end?"
- **Project phases**: "Costs before launch vs maintenance after"
- **Sale/transfer**: "You keep cashflows before the sale date, I get the rest"

**Example**: You sell a rental property mid-year. You get the rent payments before the sale date; the buyer gets payments after. This split helps determine the fair sale price!
:::

**Example**: Split transaction $\mathbf{x}''/\mathbf{t}'' = \{10, -4, -4, -4\} / \{0, 1, 2, 3\}$ at $t^* = 1.5$

**Before $t^*$** (times $\leq 1.5$):
$$
\mathbf{x}_{\text{before}}/\mathbf{t}_{\text{before}} = \{10, -4\} / \{0, 1\}
$$

**After $t^*$** (times $> 1.5$):
$$
\mathbf{x}_{\text{after}}/\mathbf{t}_{\text{after}} = \{-4, -4\} / \{2, 3\}
$$

**Verification**: $\mathbf{x}_{\text{before}}/\mathbf{t}_{\text{before}} \oplus \mathbf{x}_{\text{after}}/\mathbf{t}_{\text{after}} = \mathbf{x}''/\mathbf{t}''$ ✓

**Table representation**:

| Time | Original | Before $t^* = 1.5$ | After $t^* = 1.5$ |
|:----:|:--------:|:------------------:|:-----------------:|
| 0 | +10 | +10 | — |
| 1 | −4 | −4 | — |
| 2 | −4 | — | −4 |
| 3 | −4 | — | −4 |

#### 2. Decomposition by Algebraic Sign

Separate positive cashflows (inflows) from negative cashflows (outflows).

::: {.callout-tip icon=true}
## Intuition: Separating Money In vs Money Out

Decomposing by sign is like **having two separate jars**: one for income, one for expenses. Useful for:

- **Cash management**: "How much am I expecting to receive vs pay?"
- **Budgeting**: Separate income sources from expenses
- **Accounting**: Assets (inflows) vs Liabilities (outflows)
- **Liquidity planning**: "Do I have enough inflows to cover outflows?"

**Example**: A small business owner splits revenues (inflows) from costs (outflows) to quickly see: "Am I making more than I'm spending?" Each jar tells a different story, but together they show the complete picture!
:::

**Example**: Same transaction $\{10, -4, -4, -4\} / \{0, 1, 2, 3\}$

**Inflows** (positive):
$$
\mathbf{a}/\mathbf{t} = \{10\} / \{0\}
$$

**Outflows** (negative):
$$
\mathbf{l}/\mathbf{t}' = \{-4, -4, -4\} / \{1, 2, 3\}
$$

**Verification**: $\mathbf{a}/\mathbf{t} \oplus \mathbf{l}/\mathbf{t}' = \{10, -4, -4, -4\} / \{0, 1, 2, 3\}$ ✓

**Table summary**:

| Time | Original | Inflows (a) | Outflows (l) |
|:----:|:--------:|:-----------:|:------------:|
| 0 | +10 | +10 | 0 |
| 1 | −4 | 0 | −4 |

## Why This Notation Matters

This formal notation $\mathbf{x}/\mathbf{t}$ allows us to:

1. **Precisely specify** financial operations without ambiguity
2. **Combine transactions** algebraically using the $\oplus$ operator
3. **Decompose complex transactions** into simpler components
4. **Compare transactions** for equivalence
5. **Build up** to the value function and NPV calculations (next chapter!)

Think of it as the "algebra of money flows" — just as we can add numbers, we can now add entire cashflow streams!
:::


## Summary

Before moving forward, make sure you understand:

✅ **Cashflows** have amount, timing, and direction\
✅ **Sign convention**: Positive = inflow, Negative = outflow\
✅ **Perspective matters**: Same transaction looks different to different parties\
✅ **Three representations**: Tables, timelines, and diagrams all show the same information\
✅ **Two patterns**: Investment (− then +) vs. Financing (+ then −)\
✅ **Formal notation**: $\mathbf{x}/\mathbf{t}$ precisely describes cashflows and schedules\
✅ **Operations**: Transactions can be summed ($\oplus$) and decomposed


::: {.callout-warning icon="true"}
## Common Pitfall

Don't mix perspectives! If you start from the borrower's viewpoint, stay consistent. Switching midway through a problem causes sign errors.

**Next**: In [Chapter 2: Bonds](bonds.qmd), we'll apply these cashflow concepts to understand bond pricing and accrued interest.
