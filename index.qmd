## About This Guide

Welcome to **Financial Mathematics - Class 1**, a student-friendly reinterpretation of traditional financial mathematics lecture materials. This guide is designed specifically for MBA students with varied quantitative backgrounds.

## What Makes This Different?

- 🎯 **Cheat sheets** for quick reference

## Navigation

This guide is organized into focused chapters:

1. **Basic Notions** - Cashflows, timelines, and sign conventions

3. **Value Function** - Understanding money over time
4. **Interest & Discount Rates** - Accumulation and discount factors
5. **Cheat Sheet** - One-page reference for all key formulas
